Hello Thursdays at the Theatre folk -

We wanted you to be aware of a cool film event this Saturday, beginning 11am at the Historic Yuma Theatre.

The Yuma Film Fest, featuring local short films produced here in the last year.

These are short, unrated films, and they may be on a variety of topics, all created by local aspiring filmmakers.

A short-film competition will be held. Guest speakers Hollywood Producer Carol Kottenbrook and

Hollywood Writer/Director J.S. Cardone will be speaking about their experiences in the film industry.

The $5 day pass includes short films, an awards reception complete with live music, a presentation by local filmmaker,

and a 7pm screening of a vampire thriller called The Forsaken.

If you have time, check it out!!!

All our best,
