Arizona Western College had the privilege of hosting their annual San Luis Educational Family Night, held at the San Luis Learning Center on Oct. 4. Omar Heredia Romero, coordinator of Advising and Student Services for the South Yuma County campus, managed the event along with Laura Gauna, Mary Miranda and Susanna Zambrano, associate dean for South County Services.

Amazing food, games and raffles, along with performances by Gadsden Elementary School District #32 and San Luis High School, were all part of the amusing event. Each of the two schools had one of its departments provide entertainment. Gadsden’s award-winning marching band performed, while SLHS’s dance department had everyone on a swoon with their rhythmic dancing.

“It was a very successful event. This is the five-year anniversary, and each year it gets bigger and better,” Zambrano said. “Our partners supported us with performances through their bands and cheer teams. This event would not be possible without their backing, and we are very grateful to them.”

The purpose of these events is to promote education in a fun and engaging way. It showcases all of the college and community services, programs and degrees for students and families, while providing entertainment along with leisure activities for everyone to enjoy while also being informative. Other local agencies and local non-profit organizations also promoted such services as education and health.

AWC Transfer Services had a booth showcasing the various universities students can attend, not only in Arizona but also in Mexico for those students looking for what options are available to them for furthering their education or studying abroad.

“I love these type of events because this is how I found out about my field and how I learned about the transfer services AWC has,” said Josue A. Becerra, a Psychology major and AWC alumnus who is now at the University of Arizona. “What also surprises me is how many students attend the college that come from out of the country. It’s really wonderful to have people from different cultures and their different ideas in the college.”

“This is my third semester here at AWC, and honestly although I think they needed more booths and maybe more performers, I think it was a fun night,” said Roberto Escalante, a Customs and Border Protections Homeland Security Major. “I especially loved the marching band – always outstanding performances.”

The event was overall a great success, faculty members are looking forward to the following year.

“I was confident the event would come out as planned because the team worked arduously to organize it,” said Heredia. “The attendance at the event did exceed my expectations though. The truth is, the community came through and made an effort to support the various organizations present.”
