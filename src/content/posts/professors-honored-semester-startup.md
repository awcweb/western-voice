On Jan. 10, the AWC Foundation recognized two faculty members for their excellence in the classroom and dedication to the community with two Endowed Faculty Achievement Awards.

The Shadle/Edgecomb and Frances Morris Endowed Funds, each worth $2,000, both recognize faculty who support and motivate students, advance AWC through career opportunities, participation on committees, student activities, partnerships and community outreach. Faculty members are nominated by their co-workers, students or community members. Winners are chosen by former winners. Congrats to both of them!

Steve Lund, Professor of English as a Second Language, is known for his motto, "Class is never dismissed." In 2003 he became the first Fulbright Scholar in the history of AWC, conducting courses in teaching methodology and materials development in Presov University in Slovakia. In 2005, he received a grant to study Danish language and culture in Denmark, and in 2011 he was one of 24 educators from around the country selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities to attend a weeklong seminar on the life and work of artist Georgia O'Keefe. He joined the AWC faculty in 1995 as ESL coordinator in South Yuma County.

Steve Moore, Professor of English, started as associate faculty at AWC in 2002 while still teaching full time at Kofa High School. In 2004 he switched to full-time faculty status and spent his first year teaching in South Yuma County. He is an active member of the faculty, having served as Faculty Association President and on many committees including Assessment, Curriculum and Faculty Compensation. He likes to make a positive impact in students' lives and is accommodating with personal circumstances. He likes to be available to his students, even late nights and on weekends, helping them achieve the skills they need to move forward.
