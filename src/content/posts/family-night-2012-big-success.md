I touched a snake for the first time at Arizona Western College's annual Family Night. It was a California King and it was coiled around the arm of student, Emma English, an AWC Biology major and a member of the Science Club.

Was she scared? "No, not at all."

This was just one of the interesting and fun things to do at this year's family night.

"Last year wasn't as big as this,"said Alfonso Dominguez, president of the AWC Science Club.

Amid the crowd of AWC students, teachers, family and friends were many tables and activities spread out throughout the courtyard between the 3C and the Science & Ag buildings, with some tables inside. The huge Applebees hot-air balloon stood near the LR building created a beautiful focal point as an orchestra played on stage in the center of the activities for participants and guests visiting and leaving AWC's 2011 Family Night.

Circling around the parking lot next to the buildings was a tractor, pulling a trailer full of bales of hay and people of all ages. Beside it on the grass, were more hay bales, a fence and cages full of animals -- Silver Solid Guinea Pigs, Netherland Dwarf rabbits and chameleons, just to name a few.

A petting zoo included Boar goats and Suffolk Lambs. The animals and petting zoo were brought by the Future Farmers of America chapter at Yuma High School.

Hunter Freytag, president, said the Ridgeback Pigeon was the most exotic of the animals there.

Kids were shooting hoops and a real fire truck was on display for anyone to walk around in.

The Arizona Massage Therapy Clinic offered ten minute massages for $5.00.

The Honors program at AWC had a henna-tattoo booth. This was the first year that this service was offered at Family Night and seemed very popular, thanks to tattoo artist and second-year student Zaynab Hourani.

Face painting, arts and crafts, karaoke and even Dance Party 3 were more of the fun and interactive activities.

The food was another big part of the evening -- machaca, rice and beans combo plates, hot dogs, funnel cake, cotton candy, popcorn, Rice Krispies treats, cookies, cupcakes and so on.

Judging by the faces of the happy face-painted children and tired but content parents, this year's annual Family Night was a huge success.
