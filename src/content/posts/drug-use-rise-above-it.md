We no longer live in the era of sex, drugs, and rock and roll -- or do we? Drugs and alcohol have become such an issue worldwide that the time has come for the Arizona Western College community to raise awareness about them.

To that end, on Oct. 11 in the 3C Bldg. the AWC Nursing Program hosted the free event "Designer Drugs," filled with real-life experiences, eye-opening photos and a guest speaker.

"With all of these new designer drugs being discovered, it's time to educate students about the dangers of drug consumption," said Mary Parston, AWC director of health services. "It is all part of the alcohol and other drug prevention program."

An incident last fall on campus made Parston realize it was time to inform students about drug use and its consequences.

A knowledgeable speaker

A slide show was the main focus of the night, informing the audience about the seriousness of alcohol abuse, one of the top causes of death worldwide, and the toll it can take on the body. The lecture also discussed drugs such as marijuana, heroin, PCP and spice -- including issues of prevention, warning signs and addiction.

The guest speaker was Dr. Martin Lara, a former AWC student who now works for a mental health agency and owns his own practice. With a doctorate in behavioral health and a Master's in community counseling, he was well qualified to talk about the topic.

Lara touched on nearly every drug that is commonly abused. He mentioned how alcohol negatively affects the body, especially if abuse begins at a young age.

Lara also mentioned that, though marijuana is seen as an "innocent" drug, like all other drugs it can become addictive as the user's brain cells diminish. He also exposed the audience to more serious drugs like spice and how deadly their addiction can become.

Lara said that he agreed to speak to the AWC community because "I specialize in substance abuse, and I'm concerned about our community's health."

Many benefits

Due to his specializations and first-hand experience working with people who have been or are involved with drugs, Dr. Lara was able to offer many real-life examples.

"I really enjoyed listening to Dr. Lara," said AWC student Ashley Curiel. "He had a good sense of humor and made it very easy to understand the importance of drug abstinence."

An informative display at the back of the room included brochures and flyers about various drugs, their chemical makeup and their abuse and prevention.

"I thought the event was great," said AWC student Alvaro Arevalo. "Good facts were given about drugs as well as examples, and it really left you with something to think about."

The evening ended with a drawing of tickets given at the door. Prizes consisted of all things health related, such as weights and other exercise equipment, all of which tied into the overall theme of the night -- maintaining a healthier lifestyle, free of addiction.
