Haikus

By Nicole Trujillo

Rushing water pours

from Arizona fountain

splattering cool mist

Sharp cactus pairing

pale green beauty of our land

unmoving resource

Today, unlike Yuma

cool breezes blow pleasantries

on a hot desert

Small solar campus

filled with desirous scholars

propelled towards a promise

By Alba Amador

Twisting winding branch

the uncarring wind steals us

leaves flutter unknown

The sun is my source

the flower turns to your warmth

the wind kills petals

Man made water source

brick and mortar, beautiful

nothing grows here alone

Life

It is painting a white, white room

Always easy at first,

Till you begin.

It is working

Harder than before

It is stretching

Up on your toes

Trying to touch

The sky

It is kneeling

It is getting dirty

And finding

That you are always

One brush short

It is panicking over every mistake

And going over every mistake

It is staring at the cracks

And the streaks

It is obsession

Maybe

You will find a partner

To work alongside you

The complimentary

To your primary

Color

It is praying

They do not

Overpower your work

It is bending backwards

Holding your hands up high

It is sweating

It is sleepless nights

It is consuming

Sometimes

God will let you

Finish

Others

He will say

"begin again,"

or

"that is more than enough"

Or

"It is time to come home"

It is letting go.

By William Devey

Saying Goodbye

His tears were streaming down his cheeks. I don't really understand why he seems so sad. As he knelt beside me he told me that he will miss me. After that he pulled me in close and held me tight. I will never forget his scent; it was the one I had known since I was very young. We had been together for ten years and I knew him well, but I had never seen him like that. When he let go he patted me on the head and said, "Be a good boy," I licked his hand. He smiled and walked away. That was the last time I saw my first master.

Driving

My eyes went red as I clicked into place.

Rushed! The rage rose like the increasing speed

Behind the wheel I have become a monster

A beast of legendary tale, ready to pounce.

Attack I did with all my fury.

Honking and flipping, and chanting war cries.

Semi-trucks have become my terrible bane

They cause me to swell up and scream profanes.

Looking back my face went red,

Not out of anger, rather embarrassment instead.

Now I must say sorry to Haley I acted a fool.

The Service

The room filled with tears

though no soles were wet.

The body lay peacefully

though heartache rest in each individual.

The chants ringing repeatedly

though the silence lurked quietly.

Another hug to ease the piercing hurt of the loss

adds another tear to the mist.

Another glance at the body

throws another memory in your face.

But there is the smile that reminds you

It will be okay.

The Machine

The rubber and metal plug

is the only thing keeping you alive.

What if someone trips over it?

What if there is a blackout?

Your life rests on the two metal prongs.

How easy it would be

for an accident to happen.

For that tiny bond to be broken

and the life lost.

The heavy reliance on a manmade object

is the only thing keeping

the air in your lungs

and the blood moist in your veins.

One small miniscule mistake of calibration

or some electrical malfunction

and the life once so cherished

is gone forever.

Life Is Like Water

One day your soul settles calmly

another day it whips and crashes

You may feel elated in evaporation

or depressed in precipitation

You may feel cool and calm

or feel boiling and overwhelmed

No matter which state you are in

the cycle will continue to flow.

Conformity

The small buzzing gnat

Flying in no direction

Going with the crowd
