Sample 100-Word Stories

Back

by John Crick

We woke that last morning, broke, in the Amsterdam train station, warm under our small blanket, our backpacks as pillows. We sat up and smoked cigarettes, watching the trains and the people

"It'll be different," she said. "Once we get back."

"Yes," I said. "Different."

"We'll eat slower. No more fast food."

"Yes. Fresh baguettes. No more Wonder Bread."

"And long walks, every day. Don't you think?"

"Every day."

She smiled, her eyes still swollen from sleep, and I remembered us walking along the Seine together, holding hands, past the sunbathers and artists, happy, an ocean between us and home.

The Defining Bus Ride

by Grace Gregory (2010 second-place student)

I realized I was twenty cents short when the bus came to the stop: my first dilemma at the age of 5. The doors on the bus whooshed open and the driver gave me a weird look.

"Kid, you're holding up the line!"

No one stood behind me. I stuttered, "I-I-I'm 20 cents short sir."

"Guess I'll drop you off 2 miles short."

I shrugged and got on. When I got off, the bullies were there; I ran...I ran so far away...I ran...I ran all night and day. This is why I joined A Flock of Seagulls.

Beauty I See

by Adriana Hernandez (2010 first-place student)

I stand by the door, waiting. Her body's slightly angled from the large squared light-lined mirror.

Shiny fabric enhances her curves. Another pink-smudged tissue litters the dresser.

"This time," she says. "Promise."

Holding a small magnifying mirror, she tips her chin up, outlines her lips pink. Light falls on her neck trailing to the hollow of her throat.

Sighs. "I'm ready."

She looks herself over once more. Satisfied, she leans towards the switch. Her dress flares to life. Blinding. Click. The room goes dark. Hardly visible, she approaches. The hallway's light gets caught in her eyes. Two dazzling sparks.

Respect

by Lindette Lent (2010 first-place faculty/staff)

Three generations spread ever northward: East and west to the oceans, covering America in giant pyramidic steps. A fourth is born, eats, and flutters its little three inches all the way from Canada to Mexico.

No brain to speak of. Prismatic scales though. Pretty cool.

Caterpillars build pupae, liquefy themselves, reorganize their genes, and emerge WITH WINGS, tasters on their feet, AND an ability to get from here to there without getting lost (all of which I seem to be completely lacking).

So, if you see me weaving down the Imperial Valley highway I'm not drunk. I am butterfly dodging.
