So begins another season of powerful theatre coming your way from AWCTheatre. We hope you will be able to attend or participate as you can. Remember, we are open to all those who wish to play and in whatever capacity they wishes.

We do not charge admission for our productions, but we suggest a donation of $10, five articles of clean, wearable clothing, or five items of non-perishable food in lieu of an admission charge.

Also, unless specifically stated differently, AWCTheatre productions are all held at the same times: Sunday performances begin at 2:30 p.m., and all other performances begin at 7:30 p.m. For more information please contact the AWC Fine Arts Division at 928-344-7743.

The AWCTheatre Student production this semester is Pssst...I Must Tell You Something, Mi Amore, by Mexican playwright Ana Castillo, and is directed by AWCTheatre major Lance Guzman. Pssst opens on Friday, Oct. 11 and runs Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for two weekends, ending on Sunday, Oct. 20.

On Saturday, Oct. 26, at midnight we will offer our yearly Rocky Horror Picture Show event.

Opening Friday, Nov. 8 at 7:30 p.m. in the AWC Theater is Of Mice and Men, which promises to make people think and also to make many people cry. A classic piece of American culture that is universally relevant, Of Mice and Men will intrigue, confound and astound while presenting moral and social realities most of us never have to face.

This powerful drama needs a cast of ten men and one woman. To audition, please prepare a one-minute monologue on a serious subject from a produced play.

Thanks again for your support of the Arts in Yuma in general and AWCTheatre in particular. Come play, come see, come be a part of the 2013 Fall AWCTheatre season!
