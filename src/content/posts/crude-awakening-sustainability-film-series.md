Do you like scary films? The kind that are true stories and leave you thinking differently for the rest of your life? Or, are you just curious about what experts across the political board have to say about the oil industry? Either way, Crude Awakening is a great film for you to watch.

The FREE film about sustainability will be in the AWC Eatery inside the 3C building, Nov 8. Crude Awakening is the second of a monthly series hosted by Professor Ted Martinez throughout the school year. All screenings begin at 12:15 and again at 5pm.

A Crude Awakening is a theatrical documentary that attempts to answer two questions: When is the oil going to run out, and what's going to happen when it does? According to film critic Chris Barsanti at http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/2006/a-crude-awakening-the-oil-crash/ "a Republican congressman in (the film), along with a Bush energy adviser and a former OPEC leader" along with a motley crew of other non-green people "-- could possibly mean that it has more of a chance of being heard."

"Given the billions that have been spent on oil exploration in the last few decades," Barsanti continued, " and that new oil-field discoveries peaked in the late 1960s, the film's take is that it's all downhill from here, with the peak of production just around the corner."

The film then goes into describing the horrific aftermath of the oil industry, from the severe belt tightening that will change the way we think about everything to, ultimately, a declination in population of one or two billion people.

The full schedule planned for the series includes:

Nov 8 - A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash

Feb 14 - Blue Gold: World Water Wars

Mar 13 - Home

Apr 10 - Flow: For Love of Water
