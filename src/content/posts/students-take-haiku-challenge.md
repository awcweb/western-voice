Encompass

Rainbow in the sky

After Southwest raindrops fall

Lovers share embrace

“I Wish I Could Tell Them That the 8 is the Interstate, Not the Speed Limit”

Flock of birds move slow.

Majestic palace on wheels.

Cross yourself two times.

Solace

Looking at the stars

Autumn wind carries away

Confessions of pain

Nilda Montalvo

school time now closes

my school friends I will not see

til we met again

Nilda Montalvo

my family and

many friends God gave to me

I cherish them
