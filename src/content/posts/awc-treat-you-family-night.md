AWC Family NIght 2017

If you weren’t on campus on Nov. 16, you and your family missed out on a night full of knowledge and laughter.

The annual AWC Family Night began in 2001, and this year marked the 16th year the college has been opening its doors to the Yuma region to present Matador families with their potential future.

“It is basically AWC’s way of not only telling the community but showing them what AWC does and what it is about,” said AWC freshman Genesis Perez. “We got to show our parents what we are learning and to prove to some family members, who prefer we get into the work force, that we are actually learning a trade and demonstrating it tonight.”

Clubs and organizations representing a cross-section of the campus offered food and snacks in the Eatery, which had its glass walls opened to the evening air. The lines at all the tables were long, and some ran out of their tasty, exotic food after only an hour or so.

“It was a great way to show my parents what our money is going to, as education is an investment for not only my future but my whole family’s future, which is why I begged my parents to come with me tonight,” said sophomore Martha Chacon.

It was a relief to see some of the professors outside of the classroom environment having fun with students and talking one on one with parents about their children’s education.

Everyone who attended or participated was welcoming and helpful when it came to answering questions about some of the clubs that many parents didn’t know existed. It was a way of showing that the lower-division education offered at a community college is on a par with a state university.

Many left the event feeling that it is always a good day to be a Matador!
