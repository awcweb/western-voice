Shara Roberts has announced the audition for Missoula Children's Theatre production of The Tortoise Versus the Hare will be held on Tuesday, April 4th at4:00 pm at Post Auditorium. There are roles for students in Kindergarten through High School. Approximately 50-60 local students will be cast to appear in the show with the MCT Tour Actor/Director. There is no guarantee that everyone who auditions will be cast in the play. Students wishing to audition must arrive by the scheduled starting time and stay for the entire two-hour session. The first rehearsal begins approximately 15-30 minutes after the audition.

This is a group audition - no advance preparation is necessary, but a SMILE never hurts. Students should just be ready to come and have a good time!

Rehearsals will be conducted every day from 4:00 to 8:30 at Post Auditorium. Although not all cast members will be needed at every session, those auditioning must have a clear schedule for the entire week and if selected, be able to attend all rehearsals required for their role. A detailed rehearsal schedule will be distributed at the conclusion of the audition. Cast members scheduled for the full 4and a half hours of rehearsal will be asked to bring a sack lunch, supper or snack.

The performances will be held on April 9th at 3:00pm and will be presented at Post Auditorium. The students in the cast will be called for dress rehearsal before the performance that day. All those cast must be available for scheduled performances.

This coming year more than 55,000 cast members across the globe will take to the stage to the delight and applause of their families, friends, community, neighbors and teachers!
