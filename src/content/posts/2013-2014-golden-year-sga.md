Student leaders on campus were busier last year than usual. 2013-2014 was the Golden Year for Arizona Western College and was filled with events.

“It was a jam-packed year because of the 50th Anniversary,” said student body President Chris G. Taffe.

A full fall

Student Government Association inaugurated the year on Oct. 12 with the Homecoming celebration. During halftime at the football game, SGA made its presence noticeable by organizing a golf cart parade that included various campus clubs and programs.

Paola C. Samaniego, Vice President of Development and President of the Presidential Leadership Society, explained that SGA held a monthly meeting to inform presidents about major activities and possible fundraisers.

The other mayor event was Family Night. The crowds enjoyed the many booths and activities – for a while, at least. Various clubs had games for kids to enjoy, and food from many countries was being sold inside the Eatery.

Everything was going perfectly, but sadly the rain started to pour down and the event had to be cancelled before performances started.

Spring fever

The first major event of Spring semester, the all-day Block Party on Feb. 15, promised to bring the community of Yuma together. Some of the booths set up along Main Street helped clubs to raise funds. Past AWC presidents also attended.

One of SGA’s goals was to reach out to the community, and they did a great job by promoting school spirit throughout the year. They marched in the Veterans Day parade, Rodeo Parade and Lights Parade, and they offered college students the opportunity to watch movies, for exampleCesar Chavez, by renting whole rooms at Harkin’s Theater.

During the annual Relay For Life at Desert Sun Stadium SGA participated in the usual walk around the track and also did fundraising along with other school organizations to help out the American Cancer Society, almost reaching the $1000 mark.

Like every year, people gathered to celebrate the diversity on campus with What a Wonderful World, which showcased food, costumes and performances from around the world.

Green life and inner children

Besides the community events, Student government still managed to create events on campus in promotion of a healthy environment. The Sustainability Fair, held on April 17, promoted a more eco-friendly life. Even though, AWC campus is already self-sustainable through solar power, SGA wanted to implement the “green” life by taking a pledge to do something eco-friendly.

Towards the end of Spring 2014, SGA came together with Campus Life to create a fun Water Day. The dorm area was filled with various water slides, where residents had the opportunity to get stress free. Leonardo Ibarra, Resident Assistant from Garces, helped out with the organization.

“It’s an annual event that residents really look forward because it brings out the inner child we all have,” said Ibarra. “Residents were running around and playing with water guns and water balloons.”

Looking back, it truly was a golden year filled with celebration, with events ranging from campus engagement to community bonding. Now, with the new year kicking off, no doubt the new SGA members have grand plans of their own.
