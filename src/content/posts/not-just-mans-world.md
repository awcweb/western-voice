Two Arizona Western College judo students received belt promotions on Nov. 13 -- including the first-ever woman to achieve the rank of brown belt, according to Joseph Murek, Jr., sensei for the class which is held at Woodward Junior High School.

Veronica Soto, an AWC nursing student, expects to enter the nursing program at NAU-Yuma next semester. Soto, who has been a teacher in the Gadsden and San Luis, Ariz., school systems, has returned to school to change her career.

She started studying Judo while attending school in Flagstaff in 1990. Her husband and daughter are also members of the AWC Judo class. For her, judo is an incredible journey and family tradition.

Soto feels that judo is an important skill for women to learn. She likes the fact that Judo allows her to be active which she enjoys also as a form of exercise.

"Our world is not getting any safer," she says. "It's important to be able to defend myself without carrying a gun. Judo gives me the freedom to go shopping and feel safe."

Soto intends to stay with judo and eventually attain her black belt. She encourages other women to join the class and learn this highly satisfying sport.

Another student promoted on the same night is Michael Crilly. He is in his first semester of judo and received his yellow belt. He decided to join the AWC class for physical fitness and because he had friends in the sport.

The beginning and advanced judo/juitsu class (PER 145) will be offered again in Spring 2015.
