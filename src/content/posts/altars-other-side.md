Amalia Garzon, NAU-Yuma professor of Spanish, requires her students in Spanish for Native Speakers to participate in two events for cultural awareness. A major event that most students choose to participate in is creating an altar for the Day of the Dead, a Mexican holiday, in remembrance of family and friends who have passed away.

This year the class created an altar in the hallway of the upper level of the AC building. The altar honors Juan Gabriel, a beloved Mexican singer and musician who died this year. This loving tribute included many traditional objects including candles, a cross, a picture of the Virgin Mary and offerings such as a special bread. A picture of NAU professor, Dr. Charlie Balch, who passed away this year, was also included on the altar.
