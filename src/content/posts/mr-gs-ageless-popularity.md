Agriculture, the Colorado River and the Imperial Sand Dunes probably come to mind when a person thinks of Yuma, Ariz., but the restaurant most likely to be spoken of is Mr. G's.

Well known by the Yuma community and the many people traveling through this booming town, Mr. G's Mexican Food is a top hit. This popularity spans all ages, from babies who have just started chewing on their first tortilla, to elders who have to scrub their dentures after eating a famous burrito. The community just doesn't seem to get tired of this simple, traditional restaurant.

Authentic fare

What makes this food so irresistible? Maybe it's the fact that it's real Mexican food. Considering that Yuma is right on the U.S.-Mexico border, it is not hard for the restaurant to hire employees who know how to cook authentic beans and rice. The salsa is so delicious that many people just drink it after they finish their burrito (though a breath mint would be needed after that).

Not only are the tortillas gigantic, they are homemade, and a person can taste the freshness while devouring a mouth-watering burrito. Unfortunately, the thing that comes with the famous bean and cheese burrito is lard, to a total of nearly 650 calories. Although Mr. G's has tried to add low calorie items to the menu, such as salad, it is the delicious, high-calorie menu items that keep people coming back -- and perhaps packing on those pounds.

Overall, the menu is very extensive and includes every meal of the day. Customers have a choice of 9 different breakfast burritos and 11 types of burritos for lunch and dinner. In addition, there are tacos, hamburgers, salads, soups and a la carte items. Lastly, Mr. G's offers full dinners, such as, homemade tamales and enchiladas. Before you leave the restaurant, make sure to grab one of their homemade chocolate chip cookies or a brownie.

A long-standing institution

Another reason contributing to Mr. G's popularity is how long the restaurant has been in business. Mr. G's was once called "Taco Lita" and was then renamed Mr. G's after the Gutierrez family purchased it in 1963. Since the restaurant is located in what once was the middle of a school alley, students were the main consumers and would often walk over during their lunch break.

The menu has not changed much since then, but the price has. Once a person could buy a burrito for 75cents; now it costs $3. Although the price has gone up, Mr. G's still promotes specials every day of the week. One of the more popular specials, not hard for one to guess, is the Wednesday $1.50 bean and cheese burrito. People will fill their freezers with them and eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

Mr. G's is known for its efficiency and customer service. The restaurant has been rebuilt at the same location, which has created a comfortable setting. Mr.G's seems to always be packed with satisfied customers, who love the polite, happy employees who always make them feel welcome. Mr. G's even has a call-in service for easy pick up. Altogether, Mr. G's has taken the right steps in growing the restaurant and remaining a number-one food spot for Yuma residents and visitors.

In spite of the high calorie intake, Mr. G's keeps our community very satisfied and this food is very much missed by former residents. A person just can't get the same real Mexican flavor at a Taco Bell as they would at Mr. G's. With homemade food that has been around for generations, Mr. G's is a place that attracts people from everywhere and keeps customers returning. One can expect that, with the great food and quality service, Mr. G's will continue to be a favorite hot spot for many more generations.
