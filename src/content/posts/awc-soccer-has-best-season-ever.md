Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. Though not the most popular sport in the U.S., it is still enjoyed by many across the country. Our own soccer team, the Matadors, have never let the school down and have always made us proud. Ever since their conception in 1986, the Matadors have been making a name for themselves in the athletic and academic world.

Impressive stats

This season could be considered the greatest yet in the team’s history. The soccer team set records for most goals (53), most conference wins (14), most overall wins (16), longest home winning streak (8), longest home unbeaten streak (9), longest road winning streak (5), longest road unbeaten streak (6), longest unbeaten streak combined (11), fewest losses (5), most shutouts (10) and fewest shutouts suffered (4). They also placed third on the 2009 ACCAC Men’s Soccer Standings with 14 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties with 44 points, 53 goals in favor and 18 against. That’s 3rd, folks!

The players also set records individually for themselves. Onofre Velasco and Junior Mandujano have played in 2008 and 2009 and have 29 wins – more than any other players in the history of AWC soccer. Bello Alhasson placed first in the 2009 All ACCAC/Region 1 Men’s Soccer Team. In the Second Team ALL-ACCAC, Dejan Milosevic placed 7th , Cristobal Mendoza placed 9th, and Wally Vazquez placed 11th. Bello Alhasson also placed 3rd in the ACCAC Men Scoring Leaders with 16 goals, 9 assistances and 41 points. Abraham Villon placed 13th with 4 goals, 9 assistances and 17 points. Wally Vazquez placed 14th with 5 goals, 7 assistances and 17 points. Dejan Milosevice placed 2nd in the Men’s Leading Goalkeepers with 1,441 min., 15 goals and a GAA of 0.94.

The key to success

Kenny Dale, the soccer head coach, is very proud of this season. Praising the level of the players, Dale said that their willingness to adapt to the coaching and to each other was the key to their success. Overcoming problems such as needing a new goalkeeper and forwards and playing with just nine players against Pima and Yavapai, the team surprised Dale with its strength.

“These guys really look upon themselves to make their experience successful,” said Dale. “Their leadership was outstanding. Many of the players can play at the University level and move on, and I will be proud to coach them again.”
