The Arizona Western College Foundation held two simultaneous award ceremonies on March 8, one for top students and the other for top faculty.

The Celebration of Scholarships event honored the students who have been awarded scholarships and the donors who make the scholarships possible while the Endowed Faculty Achievement Award honored exceptional teachers. The evening's events were sponsored by Southwest Gas Corporation.

The Diana Ortiz Valenzuela Memorial Radiologic Technology Scholarship was presented by Brenda Smith and Alexandria Summers, both donors to the scholarship established to pay tribute to their recently deceased cousin. They shared the life story Diana Ortiz Valenzuela and why a Scholarship fund was established in her name.

Jim Moody, son of long time Yuma resident Robert Moody, in whose name a memorial scholarship was established, spoke of his father's lifelong involvement in helping children receive an education.

Scholarship recipients Julie Koepp and Almarie Rivera each spoke about their academic successes at AWC and expressed gratitude to their donors for the support they and their fellow scholarship winners have received. Almarie was elected the homecoming queen in 2010.

The Endowed Faculty Achievement Award for 2012 was awarded to two Arizona Western College teachers, Zoe Hawk and Dr. Paul Koblas. Hawk received the Frances Morris Endowed Award, and Koblas received the Shadle-Edgecombe Endowed Award.

The four factors weighed in determining the recipients are innovation in instruction, commitment to student success, contributions to the mission and goals of the College and their involvement in the college and civic community.

The event was attended by more than ninety people, who enjoyed hors d'oeuvres, desserts and beverages prepared by students from the AWC Culinary Arts program, with music by the AWC Jazz Ensemble playing in the background.

Congratulations are due to all the recipients, and thanks are due to all the donors and faculty who made this a meaningful event.
