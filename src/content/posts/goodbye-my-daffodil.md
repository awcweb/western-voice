Oh, ain’t it funny how things have changed?

Once lovers, then friends, now strangers,

With great sorrow that is haunting and beautiful.

Oh, ain’t it funny how we’ve tried

To see the whole wide world, eye to eye?

But, now I know it is not always so simple.

And I take this in stride, down the way;

I am deaf, dumb, and blind, so you say.

But, this ain’t easy,

What I’m leaving.

Oh, ain’t it funny how we fear

The truth of our own madness brought to life?

But, it’s only a matter of time.

And I take this in stride, down the way.

I’ve made big mistakes, as they have made me.

But, it’s a long road where I’m going.

And I shouldn’t tell you I miss you.

But I…I wanna hold you and kiss you.

I know that it ain’t right,

Not this time…

Oh, ain’t it funny how things end ?

Could’ve done it all so different, to stay your friend.

But, you gave me just one choice to decide,

The only thing I could do was take a ride.

And I take this in stride, down the way.

With my love deep inside; pray it guides me.

Cuz it’s a long road where I’m going;

It’s a long road where you’re going.

Goodbye my daffodil,

goodbye.
