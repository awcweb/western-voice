Arizona Western College's Continuing Education Division will be offering two social media courses for business professionals and entrepreneurs in March. These courses will be facilitated by Aliza Sherman, a web and social mobile pioneer, whose work helped shape the early new media industry.

On March 12 Sherman will instruct the course "Introduction to Social Media Marketing," and on March 22 she will present "Introduction to Starting a Home-Based Business." Both courses will take place at the AWC Entrepreneurial Center at 1351 S. Redondo Dr. in Yuma. Each session is $39.

Sherman started the first woman-owned internet company in the early Ã«90s, Cybergrrl, Inc. She has been writing, speaking and consulting about social media since 2006 and social-mobile marketing since 2010. She is also well known for her expertise on women's technology and business issues.

She is an advocate of sensible, practical and manageable uses of technology that achieve business goals. She deftly cuts through hype to get to the essence of what tech tools to use and how to use them well for optimal results. Her latest books are Social Media Engagement for Dummies, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Crowdsourcing and Mom, Incorporated. Aliza Sherman helped pave the way for women online and in the internet industry.

Join other like-minded professionals who want to get the most out of their technology, the World Wide Web and social media tools. Come meet Sherman in person and learn from the best!
