On April 26, the AWC Math Department had plenty to celebrate as it honored the 2009-10 American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges’ Students Mathematics League Competition participants and award winners.

This year’s team, led by coach Luis Martinez, had the “second highest team score in the state of Arizona and the fourth highest score in the Southwest region,” according to math professor Daniel Russow, and the score was “by far our highest individual and team rankings for the three years that we have competed.”

According to an announcement sent out by the Mathematics Department prior to the celebration the five highest scores were all in the top 20 in the Southwest region.

Among this year’s winners was first place Hanh Dung Dao, who placed first in Arizona, first in the Southwest region (tie), and 20th overall in the United States. Second place was Ngoc Tran, third place Hai Nguyen, fourth place Khang Vu and fifth place Douglas Sanchez.

Also honored were Diep Phan and Suyana Lozada for their participation in four consecutive semesters of competition.

Congratulations to all the participants and winners for a job well done!
