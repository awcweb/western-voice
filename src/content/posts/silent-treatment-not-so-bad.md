You may get the silent treatment from several individuals around campus tomorrow, but don't take it personal. Arizona Western College's Gay Straight Alliance for Equality (GSA4= Club) invites the campus community to participate in the national event designed to represent the silence many Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender or Questioning (LGBTQ) people often experience due to fear of hatred or discrimination. Silence is never golden when it is forced.

AWC's Day of Silence will be observed on Thursday, April 19, 2012. You will be able to tell who the participants are by checking for a band or sticker to show their support for LGBTQ individuals and express their desire to remain silent for the day.

The day of silence will end in a circle of reclaiming the voice and a brief demonstration taking place from 4 to 4:15 p.m. between the 3C and AS building.

The actual National Day of Silence will be observed on April 20, 2012. Hundreds of thousands of students nationwide take a vow of silence to bring attention to anti-LGBT name-calling, bullying and harassment in their schools. For more information visit www.DayofSilence.org
