Students from various high schools around Yuma County, Matadors both present and future, AWC faculty and staff, and members of the general public flooded the booths at the Schoening Conference Center on November 5. Many wandering and eager minds came to explore the amazing opportunities the College has to offer.

Touting more then 30 majors -- Media Arts, Message Therapy, Culinary Arts and so many more -- AWC staff and even some students were on hand to give out helpful and encouraging information and to inform others of great career opportunities.

Our visitors were also able to connect with AWC upper-division partners such as Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University and the University of Arizona.

"It's excellent!" said organizer Mel Parker. "This is a better turnout than last year. Booths are crowded.

"The main purpose is for people to learn, engage and ask questions," Parker said. "This is our third year for our majors fair, and this is the best attended."

Throughout the event, which ran from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., raffle tickets were given out, entitling Fairgoers to T-shirts and other cool prizes. In addition, six AWC clubs were outside the 3C building next to Starbucks giving away food, beverages and useful information.

AWC also mobilized academic advisors and other registration professionals to get students started down the right path on their degrees, certificates and transfer opportunities.

"We have a lot of students stopping by interested in types of degrees, transfers and vocational and certificate programs," said Academic Advisor Yolanda Rios. "It's good to see so many young people taking advantage of this opportunity. To see them so interested and involved in continuing their education is great."

The visiting students all seemed to be having a blast.

"It's pretty cool because we get to explore other careers, some I didn't even know about until I attended this Majors Fair," said high school student Bryanna Aguiniga, 17.

"It's nice that Arizona Western is giving us the opportunity to see what is out there," she continued. "I plan to come to AWC next year, so this was actually very helpful in deciding what I want to do for my future career."

While very busy, our Major's Fair was a complete success. The world is so big and the possibilities so unlimited that the campus needs to pause once a year to help educate students on what's out there.
