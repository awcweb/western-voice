The Arizona Western College art gallery in room AB110 (across from the gymnasium) will be highlighting the Barrier to Bridges display until March 8 with photographs from professional immigrants and their stories.

The photos provide a vast range of everyday scenes that tug at your emotions as well as entertain, as great photography should do.

My favorite is the one by Juan Kress with the two guys looking out over the ocean,” said student Beth Fisher. “I imagine them dreaming about a better life, planning their future. It’s very calming and peaceful.”

The campusart galleryis open Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.and is free to the public.
