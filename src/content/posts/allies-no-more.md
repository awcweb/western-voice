Allied Waste of Yuma has generously donated two large recycling dumpsters to the Arizona Western College campus. The only problem is, no one is using them.

The old saying is true in this case: If you don't use it, you lose it. Considering Yuma's lack of recycling programs, it would be unfortunate if the dumpsters were removed due to lack of use.

AWC wants to encourage students and local residents to bring their plastic, cardboard, and aluminum cans (no glass, please!) from home and put them in the large blue dumpsters located between the Child Development Learning Lab and the SR building on the east end of campus.

Help Yuma catch up to the rest of Arizona and the rest of the country: Reduce, re-use, recycle!
