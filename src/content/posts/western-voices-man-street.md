Nicole Northcutt went out on the street and asked AWC students, "What do you do in your own life to be sustainable?"

Ahmed Hourani, 15, Biology major: “I recycle, and at every given opportunity I talk to people about living a more sustainable life because resources are running out.”

Colin Wendt, 19, Environmental Science major: “I reuse water bottles, recycle and pick up other people’s trash when I can.”

Diana Lupercio, 18, General Studies major: “When I brush my teeth, I turn the faucet off when I’m not using it to save some water, and I rarely drink bottled water.”

Elizabeth Vargas, 19, Studio Art major: “I pay attention in my Environmental Science class, and I make recycled art such as masks out of newspapers.”

Ericka Encinas, 18, major undecided: “I recycle around campus and at home. I try not to use plastic because it’s not biodegradable.”

Lisa Zvingowaniseyi, 22, Hotel & Restaurant Management major: “I recycle in all three of the dorms, and I set up programs to educate students on sustainability.”
