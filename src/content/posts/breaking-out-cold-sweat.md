Public Speaking -- it can bring even the most outgoing and confident among us to our trembling knees. What makes public speaking so dreadful is that it strips us naked and sets us on a stage for everyone to examine and point out every our flaws.

No one likes to be judged, and speaking in front of people exposes us to that. Worst of all, when we're up in front of an audience, we don't know what the public is thinking of us.

Of course, some people are natural-born speakers, and talking in public is a walk in the park. But, for the rest of us, the task borders on torture. However, fret not! There are ways to overcome this fear; all it takes is a little practice. Here are some tips for giving that dreaded speech:

Prepare. Write out what you are going to say, then read it to yourself out loud. The more familiar you are with the speech or presentation, the more comfortable you will be with it therefore decreasing your anxiety.

Rewrite. If you're still not comfortable with saying your speech and if the occasion allows, revise it so that it sounds like something you would say. Write your speech so it sounds natural and not overly rehearsed or too formal. Of course, avoid slang.

Rehearse. Practicing in front of a mirror may feel weird, but it helps you to stay aware and maintain control of your facial expressions. Visualize yourself speaking confidently in front of an audience to help ease nerves.

Case the joint. Being aware of your surroundings can also help. Arrive early to the venue, and take a walk around the room to make the experience more comfortable.

Relax. Learn how to relax before giving a speech by doing exercises. Breathe in slowly, hold your breath for a few seconds, then slowly exhale. If you want to relax your facial muscles, open your mouth and eyes wide, then close them tightly.

Put on a good face. When giving a speech, don't apologize for being nervous. Usually, nervousness doesn't show, and if nothing is said about it, it goes unperceived.

Connect with your listeners. Audiences want to see their speakers succeed, so turn that nervous energy into enthusiasm for your speech.

Just remember, it takes practice to become a great speaker.
