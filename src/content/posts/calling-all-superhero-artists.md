The League of Artists, also known as Art Club, is made up of roughly fifteen members who collaborate to showcase some of Arizona Western College’s artistic talents. Their goal is to allow them to be “more involved in the community,” says club president Amanda Carbajal.

Carbajal, who has been a member for two years, says that the League has participated in a variety of community events throughout the year as a part of their volunteer work.

“Being involved in the community helps us to put our name out there in the public,” she says.

One such event the club volunteered in was face painting for a local elementary school, Desert Mesa, for their fall festival. The club also fundraises for scholarships and trips by selling art and pottery made by its members. Most important, they fundraise for their trip to Bisbee for the 2016 Pit Fire Pottery Festival.

“It is one of our main trips we go on,” Carbajal says. “It allows for all artists to be together and have fun.”

Ceramic pots distributed by art students are put beneath stacked wood and set on fire, causing the ceramic to turn into pottery. The event helps the students by allowing them to interact with artists from other Arizona counties while admiring each other’s work.

The club hopes to expand their membership and increase its diversity.

“You don’t need any artistic background to join,” Carbajal says. “You just have to be creative.”

The main requirement to be a member is to be energetic and dynamic. If you want to join a group at AWC that’s outgoing and aspires to be an active part of the community, then the League of Artists is right for you.
