Finals are upon us and, along with them, lots of stress. Most of us students are wishing hard that it will all be over as quickly and painlessly as possible. The truth is that those finals really aren't as bad as we think they will be√ñusually.

Of course, good time management is vital. A refresher such as reading over notes or practicing math problems several times should help.

On the other hand, while studying is definitely a large part of our preparation for finals, it can actually hinder our success if it feels like too much of a burden. Worrying only makes matters worse, so it's best to relax, not overdo it and just be confident about what we've learned.

From personal experience, I have studied endlessly for a final and then, when the time came, I went blank. The next semester, I still studied, but not incessantly, and remembered a lot more than I expected.

Even if we don't remember every single thing from class, there is bound to be some knowledge about the semester floating around in that brain of ours. We actually retain lots of information, so when we see a question we automatically remember learning about the subject.

Also, we should not try to take a final without a good night's sleep or on an empty stomach. Being well rested aids our ability to concentrate and can lessen stress. And, a growling pit of emptiness doesn't make us or the person sitting next to us very happy, either.

A few tips given by collegefashion.net for avoiding stress before finals include:

Avoid stressful people. (An overly tensed friend's invitation for a study session should be avoided. That person's stress will only add to yours.)

Eat healthy and exercise. (Pass up that chocolate bar with tons of sugar and reach for a granola bar or fruit instead.)

Just say NO. (Don't agree to just hang out or party and forget about studying. It might not be easy to resist blowing off studying, but it will be worth it when you pass your finals!)

Force yourself to take breaks. (Taking a few minutes every so often to take your mind off studying can help you relax.)

Visualize everything going great. (It might sound lame, but imagining everything turning out fine can ease your negative thoughts.)

Get up your confidence. (Believing in yourself can be a great confidence booster all its own.)

Taking those finals depends on your attitude and confidence. As long as you believe you will do fine, that will most likely be the outcome.
