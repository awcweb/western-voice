In observance of Arizona Western College's 50th Anniversary, the AWC Foundation is sponsoring the newly-formed AWC Alumni Association to provide scholarships and help connect students to the workplace. David Godley, Professor Emeritus at AWC, has been named president of the new Association.

"The forming of an alumni association after 50 years is well overdue and well needed, and I couldn't be any more surprised or more proud to serve as the first president," says Godley. "It's quite an honor. I've spent nearly 43 years at Arizona Western College or NAU as a student and faculty member."

The Association is still going through the formative stages such as adopting by-laws and recruiting formal members. But, with the support of the AWC Foundation, the Association has already awarded ten scholarships for the current fall semester.

According to Godley, the goal of the Association is to encourage former students to give back to the institution in the form of inspiration and assistance to current and prospective students, as well as to keep former students apprised of current AWC happenings. Over the next several years, Godley would also like to see the Association establish and maintain a Hall of Fame that recognizes the accomplishments of former AWC students -- scholars or professional athletes "who are making a difference on the world on a stellar scale" and who are assisting current students as they were assisted while attending AWC.

Godley, who still teaches at AWC and NAU as an adjunct faculty member, brings a wealth of experience to the table. He served on nearly every committee at AWC over the years as well as on the State-Wide Articulation Task Force. He served as the Sam Walton Fellow (faculty advisor) for SIFE, academic advisor for the Business and Liberal Arts Division and first Senate Faculty President for two terms.

As the first-ever AWC Alumni Association President, he will serve on the AWC Foundation Board of Directors.

Christina Hawkey, Executive Director of the Foundation, says, "I have worked closely with David at AWC since 1999. I know he will do an incredible job as the AWC Alumni President. He has a great love for AWC."
