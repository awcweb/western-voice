“You think you are the only one out there who is suffering,” were the solemn words spoken by 18 year old Felipe Jimenez when asked why the Relay for Life is so important to him.

”You get to see how people support you , the other cancer survivors and the people who have passed away.”

“I was overwhelmed,” said Shauna Green, first time supporter and chaperone for the San Luis High School National Honor Society, “I didn’t realize that it was such a huge event.” She went on to state that she had purchased a luminary for four years, but that “it was beautiful to see them lit up, first hand, and to experience all the support of the friends and family.”

Organizations also showed up in teams to take walking shifts and show their support. One such team was the combined effort of AWC’s Honor Society and Phi Theta Kappa. Led by Kasey Fri, this dedicated team was able to raise over $1000.00 through the pre-event luminary sale and bake sale during the event, in which they took 10-15 volunteers to walk all night. Kasey described the night as a gathering of a “community,” who can come together under “one goal,” and share the excitement and the sadness in the fight against cancer. “I started walking four years ago, but three and a half years ago my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and died from it,” Kasey stated, “cancer is a part of my life.”

Lit by luminaries purchased in honor of loved ones, the track and the area around it was filled with tents, vendors, and the singing and dancing of those celebrating life. All night long, April 17th & 18th, people from all walks of life came together to show their support and walk around the track in the Relay for Life, sponsored by the American Cancer Association.
