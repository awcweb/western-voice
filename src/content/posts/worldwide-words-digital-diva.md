What if I told you that out there's a pop idol out there that has over 110,000 songs in over seven languages, has held concerts globally -- and the best part is, she isn't even real!

As unbelievable as this may sound, we are talking about a piece of software that was developed by Crypton Future Media as a voice synthesizer and that went viral all over Japan and across the planet. This is the "life" of the world-famous virtual idol, Hatsune Miku.

A virtual reality

Holographic technology has evolved to make all of Hatsune's concerts a virtual reality. Most amazing is that this viral spread of fame was not accomplished over years, but within days.

Developed in 2004 as software known as Vocaloid, Hatsune is capable of singing any song on demand. "If you can make it, Hatsune Miku will sing it," stated the program's creator and director, Hiroyuki Ito.

The program was a huge success right off the bat, and quickly grew in popularity from web page to web page. With millions of fans all across the globe, "it" ultimately became known as a "she."

People began to ask for more, and Crypton Future Media delivered with a new and revolutionary idea, a holographic concert. This concert would make Hatsune Miku and the rest of the Vocaloids able to perform for large crowds as actual pop stars instead of solo computer programs. These concerts have been held in many important places such as New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Theatre du Châ€štelet in France. Even our little community college isn't immune to the Hatsune Miku fever that is "Sharing the World."

The invasion of AWC

Hatsune Miku's words have spread, and students at Arizona Western College have heard and begun their journey of appreciation.

"Vocaloid allows us to bring ideas together in the shape of songs," said Ernesto Duarte, a Secondary Education major.

"I believe Vocaloid software has made it easier for artist to express themselves and use these technological beauties to do extraordinary things to entertain the public," said Laura Vazquez, an adjunct English professor and City of Yuma recreational instructor. "I am already a fan of her and Vocaloids in general since there is something for everyone's tastes."

Some people were not aware of her huge presence, but they did know about her existence despite the fact they are not related to this culture.

"I'm willing to find out what it is about and, sure, I wouldn't mind becoming a fan," said Daniella Laurel, a Media Arts major at AWC.

Last November, the poster drawn by former AWC student Yisel Espinoza for the Student Art Exhibit featured a full-color interpretation of Hatsune dancing in one of her famous songs, "World's End Dancehall."

"I had been meaning to attend the Vocaloid concert that a well-known convention offered," said Vazquez. "I think the live holographic concerts are a great experience and option for a fan wanting to see an artist who does not have a physical body. All fans have the right to appreciate their favorite form of art in any way that makes them happy."

"If a concert were to come to Los Angeles, I would like to go and even buy a VIP pass for it," said Media Arts major Ricardo Herrera.

"Without a doubt I would attend her concert if it was near here," added Duarte. "I would save a lot of money because I know for sure I would spend money on merchandise."

Global saturation

Everyone has his or her own way of expressing the Hatsune Miku fan inside them. Some even go to video game or anime conventions in complete makeovers, known as Cosplays, commemorating Hatsune. This has become a staple in anime culture and even gaming culture, and Yuma stores such as Hastings, Hot Topic and even Walmart have their share of Vocaloid/Hatsune merchandise.

While most of Hatsune's songs aren't even in English, people have developed a strong sense of attachment towards her words and embrace her voice with open arms. Back in 2007, a Hatsune Miku song "World is Mine" became the seventh-best-selling single worldwide in the iTunes Store, not to mention her appearance on the talk show Late Night with David Letterman, where she made her debut with "Sharing the World," spoken in English for the first time in public.

Sony has made agreements with Crypton Future Media that allows them to create music games off the Vocaloid characters for their gaming platforms like PlayStation. From 2009 to 2015, a total of 11 games have been released in and outside of Japan for multiple Sony systems such as PSP, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and even PlayStation Vita. Commercials from big-time companies such as McDonalds and Toyota have "hired" her to promote their products such as Hatsune Miku toys with the colors of Ronald McDonald and cars like the Toyota Corolla.

There is simply no denying how strong her image is. Many have speculated that this just might be the future for idols as we transition into the digital holographic age. Despite many contradictions, nothing will stop the worldwide words coming from Hatsune Miku -- the digital diva.
