If you haven’t stepped into the AWC Art Gallery to see the creations of the Faculty Exhibition you are missing out on a real treat. The art exhibits give us a wonderful glimpse of the varied imaginations of Professors Angel Luna, Stacy Blackmer-Blomquist, Bill Blomquist, George Tomkins, and Kory Roundtree.

Many exhibits are intriguing works that gave me the feeling of stepping into some bizarre dream with everything from very abstract paintings by Bill, a square hole in a belly of a sculpture by Angel, to a cave like painting with a centaur (half man, half horse) also by Bill.Then, there are the other, more realist exhibits equally appealing and creative, such as interesting stoneware by George, an astronaut by Kory and a sculpture of a field worker by Angel that every Yuman can relate to.

My personal favorites were the sculpture by Stacy of a pair of shoes in aSculpture by Stacy Blackmer-Blomquist.

very expressionist form and a clown like sculpture by Angel. The shoes represented, to me, a political perspective in an extremely unique way, a synonym to the barefoot movement of the sixties with maybe an element of a timeless revolution as the theme because of their subtle references to ancient style. Angel’s clown face sculpture appealed to me because of the various textures and use of color in the clown face, defining the emotions with red triangles and yellow that could represent egg on his face. These interpretations, of course, are strictly mine and each one will mean something different to everyone; that is the beauty of such great artwork.

I have only mentioned a few of the many exhibits in the gallery. Each exhibit is an interesting concept of ideas and/or social-political-economical representation that left me highly appreciative and contemplative.Don’t miss this fascinating experience.

The gallery is located in AB 110 and is open Monday through Thursday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The show will run until September 16th.
