"... 'Keely and Du' is exactly what a college production should be a hard, objective look at two sides of an intense debate." Katherine Miller

Jane Martin's Keely and Du chronicles the fate of Keely after she has been raped and seeks an abortion. Keely has a developingand changing relationship with her adversary Du, the fundamentalist Christian who guards her to prevent her from terminating her unwanted pregnancy.

As always, AWC Theatre does not charge for admission, but does request a donation of either five articles of clean, wearable clothing, or five non-perishable food items, or five dollars. The food is donated to the Yuma Food Bank, the clothes go to the Crossroad Mission and the money helps produce AWC Theatre events.
