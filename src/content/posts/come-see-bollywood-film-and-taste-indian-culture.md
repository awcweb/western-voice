Good news for Bollywood fans!

Yes, that’s Bollywood, not Hollywood. The India Association of Yuma plays Hindi movies with English subtitles once a month at Main Street Cinemas. The India Association is a local group responsible for planning and hosting events for the Asian Indian community throughout the Yuma area.

The latest film shown was titled “Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani” on November 19.The next film in the series is the comedy “De Dana Dan,” scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Dec. 15.

“Bollywood comes to Yuma”

Vinod Mohindra, an Association member, was quoted in September 2009Yuma Sunarticle, “Bollywood Comes to Yuma,” as saying that many people are interested in the movies but don’t know about them and that “40 percent of the people who come are non Asian-Indians.”

Mohindra says that, thanks to increased promotion in theYuma Sunand publishing of event information on EventsInYuma.com, attendance is even now even higher. He says that the screening room is now more than half full, but there’s plenty of room for more.

These Bollywood movies, brought to Yuma by a Los Angeles distributor, will remain successful as long as they have enough of an audience, says Mohindra, who also has been promoting them via email.

The discounted early-admission prices are $10 for adults, and $8 for children ages 4 and above. The regular box-office prices are $11 for adults and $9 for children ages 4 and up.
