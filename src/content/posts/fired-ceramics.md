Shadows from ancient days could be seen adorning the walls in geometric patterns for about a month this semester, when small ceramic heads created by Steve Dilley, the new Professor of Ceramics, were displayed in the Art Gallery at Arizona Western College.

Dilley, who comes to AWC from Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, Cal., describes his work as pages out of his diary that reflect the significant influences in his life, such as the death of his mother. Dilley's mother was a nurse, so one of the themes often seen in his work is nurse's caps.

His work also provides insights into his contemplative nature as he examines his place in the world and searches for enlightenment.

At Saddleback College, Dilley created the Veterans Art Project, which he would also like to see instituted here at AWC. The VAP, a grant-funded project for military veterans, active duty personnel and their spouses, provides help in overcoming Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and in adjusting to life after combat by providing a safe, supportive environment.

Dilley would like to invite all students to take a ceramics course, saying that working with clay has a synergistic influence on many scholarly disciplines. His own interest in ceramics started in high school, and he received his Master in Fine Arts in ceramics and glass at California State in Fullerton.

"As an activity, ceramics leads to a deeper understanding of the materials, processes, and opportunities a college education offers," says Dilley.
