Many stand in wonderment about how a state who claims fair and just treatment for everyone can even consider such a law as the SB1070. Those who oppose the new law believe that it is nothing but a gross misuse of power fueled by discrimination and prejudice, not to mention ‘extremely unethical.’ According to the Senate Republican Conference, however, the estimated illegal immigrant population was 15 million in 2008. That is a figure that is totally unacceptable in any country.

If you look at this problem from an internatonal perspective, no country wants illegal immigrants for a wide variety of reasons. Taxes and crime rates are only a few of those reasons. Here are a few statistics that define the problem:

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security report:

1. 83% of warrants for murder in Phoenix are for illegal aliens.(These are only the crime figures that are reported. There are estimated to be many more murders and crimes which remain unreported due to the underground community in which they live.)

2. 40.1% of all inmates in Arizona detention centers are Mexican nationals

3. 53% plus of all investigated burglaries reported in Arizona are perpetrated by illegal aliens.

4. 63% of cited/stopped drivers in Arizona have no license, no insurance and no registration for the vehicle. Of that 63%, 97% are illegal aliens

5. 380,000 plus “anchor babies” were born in the US to illegal alien parents in just one year, making 380,000 babies automatically US citizens.

6. 97.2% of all costs incurred from those births were paid by the American taxpayers

Also, the Social Security Administration reported in 2005 that out of the $75 billion dollars reported on W2 forms by employers, only $9 billion dollars of the taxes were actually paid. The missing dollars are postulated to be alien workers giving false information.

The cost of food stamps, subsidized housing, educational costs (including special bilingual teachers and extra police to patrol the halls), traffic violations and cost of higher insurance from hit and run illegal drivers, etc. are not even included.

As if all of that wasn’t enough to convince you that something needs to be done about the illegal immigration problem, there is the topic of health care concerns. Ten years ago Tuberculosis was almost non-existent in the USA. It was formerly endemic ONLY to Mexico, but now has crossed over the borders in record numbers. 81% of all TB cases today are attributed to illegal immigrants. Other diseases that are brought into the country are Hepatitis A, B and C, HIV, head lice, leprosy, and many others. California has had 84 hospitals that filed bankruptcy because of the unending line of illegal immigrants who didn’t have insurance and couldn’t pay for their medical treatment. Many other hospitals across the country are facing the same dilemma, leaving thousands upon thousands of people in rural communities without access to health care.

Although the racial implications that such a law as the SB1070 mimics are not ideal, and I honestly am not one to side with conservative issues, ethically speaking, the consequences of inaction is to live as victims in our own country and fear for the lives of all those we love. No one can argue with the numerical facts. This is a very serious problem that needs addressed. Considering the fact that in some countries the penalty for illegal entry is death, Arizona is being as fair as it can be under the circumstances until someone comes up with a better solution.

Those against the bill say the illegal immigrants come to the U.S. for a better life. Ethically speaking, however, a ‘better life’ consists of being in accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct or practice. Putting one’s self and loved onesin a position of incarceration or death is not ‘a better life.” Supporters of the bill only want illegal immigrants to take the necessary steps to become legal and adopt the laws of the land, just as their ancestors did who stood proud beside the statue of liberty, a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants throughout the centuries.

For those of you who would like to add your voice on the matter, KAWC is sponsoring an SB1070 Public Forum which includes a panel consisting of District 24 State Representatives, Lynne Pancrazi and Russ Jones, District 24 State Senator, Amanda Aguirre, Yuma County Sheriff, Ralph Ogden and the Director of American Beginnings, Fernando Quiroz.

Members of the public are encouraged to attend.

The KAWC SB1070 Public Forum will be held Thursday, June 10th at 6:30PM in the Arizona Western College Schoening Conference Center. The event will be recorded for future broadcast on KAWC.
