KAWC radio offers a great program weekdays at 6:00 p.m. from Native Voice One (NV1), whose support services are provided by the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS).

According to its web site mission statement, NV1 "educates, advocates, and celebrates Native American life and culture by providing a program service from a Native point of view." The programming carried by KAWC is "National Native News." It provides a variety of Native American news, culture,music, events and life from around the country.

NV1's music programming includes traditional, Native R&B and Hip Hop. The website invites listeners to "explore the rich variations of sound, language and indigenous expression from the Arctic to South America -- listening for their messages and fundamental contributions to the evolution of American music."

The station also addresses issues that affect every element of society, with programs such as "Healing the Wounds of Suicide" and the thought-provoking "Bullying in the Workplace."

The entire NV1 broadcast can be accessed online at www.nv1.org, an online station with a wide range of programming for not only Native Americans but anyone interested in Native American social and cultural issues.
