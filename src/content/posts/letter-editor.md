To the Editor:

Recently, (9/1), Y.C.A.T. had some cutbacks,brought on by the intentional refusal of funding by the Mayor of Yuma. This caused the bus system to cut out bus service to A.W.C. at night & some service to the foothills, etc. This situation has caused a great deal of hardship for some A.W.C. students who would otherwise be enjoying a great academic experience at A.W.C. I know, I am one of them.

I'm enrolled in 2 classes & both of them are scheduled from 5:55 p.m. to 8:35 P.M. I can get to campus by bus during the day O.K., but then I'm in effect stranded there after class at 8:35 P.M. The only other way to get home is by my bicycle, some 7 plus miles, in the dark, down Highway 95, back to Downtown Yuma. This is very physically strenuous for me, being a Dis-abled, severly arthritic, 57 year old "senior citizen " with a heart condition (stent implants ) .

This situation seems to have fallen off the radar screen, gone by the wayside, unnoticed by most everyone, including the President of A.W.C. & everyone under his direction, Duh nobody cares, typical Yuma!

I'm writing this Editorial piece in the hope of bringing this to the attention of anybody who might give a rat's tail about it & might be able to offer some help in finding a resolution to a problem that some of the fellow students are having with transportation.

Thanks !!!

A Struggling Fellow Student ,
