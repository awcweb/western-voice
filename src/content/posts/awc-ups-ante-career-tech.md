Looking at the before and after photos of the recently renovated automotive lab on the campus of Arizona Western College, it's easy to understand why there is so much excitement regarding the Pipeline Grant.

What once resembled a dungeon now features state-of-the art technology and a modern facility that would make any car dealership jealous. The diagnostic equipment, computer simulators, classroom space and everything else, right down to the shiny new floors, have suddenly made the automotive department a crown jewel of the campus.

Similar work is currently being done on the welding lab that will make it another first-class facility that AWC can be proud of.

Light at the end

The Pipeline Grant, awarded to AWC by the U.S. Department of Education in 2011, is being distributed to the College over a five-year period. AWC and NAU-Yuma have utilized their pre-existing partnership to create a transfer curriculum enabling students to earn their Associate of Applied Science degree at AWC and transfer into a Bachelors of Applied Science program at NAU-Yuma.

Students will now be able to finish their Bachelor's in welding or automotive here in Yuma, which was not possible before. The Bachelor's programs offer more training in the business and managerial aspects of welding and automotive careers, giving students the tools to find better and higher paying jobs in the field.

"The whole goal is to make sure that, when our students finish their Associate of Applied Science, they can do something else in the way of education," said Paul Neuman, director of the Pipeline Grant.

Homegrown professionals

The AWC Career and Tech program offers classes in welding, automotive and industrial technology, to name a few. For example, students can earn a certificate in solar-panel installation, one of the Yuma area's fastest-growing technologies.

The grant has allowed for students to continue the educational path of these careers so that they may have a competitive advantage when entering the work force.

Wanda Reid, an advisor for the grant, says a major portion of the funding went toward renovating the welding and automotive facilities.

"The update of the facilities needed to be done to attract and retain students," said Reid. "If you're going to give technology degrees, you have to have the latest technology."

The opportunity that this grant affords students is undeniable. Now, instead of spending all that money transferring to other schools to finish their education, students are able to complete a B.A.S. degree in the technology field of their choice right here in Yuma -- not to mention they will be trained in some of the best facilities in the area.

"Yuma doesn't have enough graduates in these fields," said Reid. "The idea is to train individuals in the community so they stay in the community."
