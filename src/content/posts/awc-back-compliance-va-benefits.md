Many people join the military at least in part because of one important benefit: The U.S. government will pay for them to go to college.

It’s an incredible opportunity for students who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford a higher education. What many don’t realize, though, is that the institution of their choice must also do its part to ensure that these benefits are available.

More than a one-woman job

A few years ago, Arizona Western College was audited by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in regard to these educational benefits. The findings were not what the VA wanted, so the College was asked to fix certain aspects of the program.

Then, two years ago, a secondary audit was performed. Again, the College failed to meet the necessary requirements and was suspended from providing benefits to future students until the problem was rectified.

Enter Gabriela Siqueiros-Herwig.

Herwig, our Veteran Affairs Coordinator, was brought in by Bryan Doak, Dean of Admissions and Enrollment Services, to spearhead the monumental task of bringing AWC’s veteran services back into compliance. And she realized right away that it was more than a one-woman job.

“At that point, Dr. Mayle and Bryan were gracious enough to offer me some extra help, and I now have a full-time VA advisor and a full-time compliance specialist,” said Herwig. “Between the three of us, we make sure students are taking only what they need and make sure we are staying on task as far as reporting to the VA.”

Responding to rule changes

Part of the compliance issues involved which classes veterans are allowed to take as well as the reporting of any changes to the VA.

“Every course that a veteran takes with us while using their VA benefits has to fit within the degree program they’re in,” Doak said. “If the course isn’t within the specified program, you can take it, but the VA won’t reimburse you for that class.

“We basically have to track each student individually from the time they enroll to the time they get the grade from the faculty member, to make sure they have been attending the class,” Doak added. “The VA will pay as long as the student is attending, but the minute the student drops the class or is academically withdrawn, that communication has to go back to the VA.”

The VA’s crackdown on schools is due to benefits changes made in the last decade.
