Dear Campus,

I just received notification that our "Turn It Off Campaign" has won a Paragon Award through the National Council for Marketing and Public Relations. The Arizona Western College winning entries were:

1) Government Relations or Community Relations project: "Turn It Off Campaign"

2) Wild Card: "Turn It Off Campaign Light Switch Plate"

I want to congratulate Dean of Marketing and Public Relations Lori Stofft, Graphic Designer Scott McKeogh and Director of District Operations Steve Eckert, the conceptual creator of this energy-saving campaign.

Thank you for making a difference on our campus for the next generation and beyond.

-Dr. Mayle
