Polina Severina has come halfway around the world to play volleyball. Still, she looks about as comfortable as a girl from Moscow can get in the desert.

Yuma isn't where Severina thought she'd end up when she decided to come to the U.S., though.

Lady Matador's Head Coach, Jason Smith, explains, "She was trying to go to a Division I school and they called and said they didn't have a scholarship available: ëWill you take her?' We said, ëYeah, we'll take her.'"

Neither of them has looked back.

A long way from home

Upon arriving in the U.S., Severina knew some English, but struggled mightily at first. "I knew a little bit of English from school. I could understand a little, but could barely speak it at all," said Severina. "Since last year, I've improved a lot."

Certain things were bound to be a bit difficult. Severina laughs when reminded of the PowerPoint presentation she had to give in her Communications class last year. "I was so nervous!" she said, smiling.

Most people, when they are a little unsure of their new surroundings, try to stay in the background and not be noticed. But that wasn't easy for the 6'4" Russian.

Besides learning a new language, Severina was learning a whole new culture.

"Everything is just so different here. It's nothing like back in Moscow," she said.

Severina was able to go back home to Moscow over the summer, see her friends and family, and do some of the things she missed about Russia.

"Moscow is a very big city" she said. "There are so many different places to go and things to do."

A different game

While she misses everyone back home and the city she grew up in, she has found a new home with Lady Matadors volleyball. Her maturation from year one to year two, which Coach Smith has seen unfold first hand, is quite a metamorphosis.

"She's tremendously different," says Smith. "She's letting her own personality show. She's has a very happy personality, which I didn't see at first."

The bond between Smith and his international players is often stronger than with other players.

"We go through so much together," he said. "They've started to refer to my wife as Mama Jen because she's like their mom away from home. She likes to dote over them and give them hugs. They need that family support."

Another aspect of acclimatizing to America has been learning American-style volleyball.

"The Russian style is a lot slower," Smith said. "They play what you would call a smarter brand of volleyball. They don't hit it out as much, and set the ball much higher. Just little things."

"I think it's a little different sport from this," said Severina. "They have different technical skills. American volleyball is more fast paced and more strong."

Severina's game has gotten better with each match this season. Her inspired play has come just at the right time as the Lady Mats have entered post-season play.

While Severina loves to go back home to visit family, she's pretty sure she has found a home for good here in the U.S.

"It's totally different from life in Russia, but I see my future in America," she said.

Right now, Severina is working on a General Studies major and isn't sure where the next stop is on her American tour. She is not too worried about the distant future, though -- only about AWC volleyball and the next big match.

What does she want to do after college? Severina only has to think for a second: "Play volleyball."
