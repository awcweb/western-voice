The annual Arizona Western College Chili Cook-Off has become very popular as the years have gone by. This year the event was part of Homecoming week for the first time. It took place on September 25 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in the grassy area next by the 3C building.

The day's festivities began with the Homecoming Parade. Participants walked from the East side of campus and led everybody to the 3C building where the Chili Cook-Off was taking place. Once there, students, staff and alumni paid $5 to taste all six different types of chili competing for the number one spot.

One group of competitors was the Chili Bytes, consisting of Josue and Kifer, who have been involved for two years now. It took them between two and three hours to make the pot of chili.

"Our ingredients consist of beans, tomatoes, lean meat and a secret ingredient," explained Kifer. "We used about twelve pounds of meat."

"I would definitely say it is worth it," said Josue. "We have a great cause to put our money towards. Even if we do not win, that's not the point. Although of course we want to."

Another competitor was Charlie, a Business faculty member of Northern Arizona University, who served a spicy chili.

"I have been doing this for six years, and I enjoy it every time," he said. "It cost me over $100, but I do it for fun. Even though we'd love to get the trophy."

The event also had KECY members to MC the event. Anna Chaulk and Eduardo Santiago were the ones keeping everybody informed by announcing upcoming events. There was a great atmosphere and great music while people enjoyed good chili.
