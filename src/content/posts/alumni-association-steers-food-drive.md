AWC's Alumni Association kicked off this year's community service projects with a food drive to help the Yuma Community Food Bank's SOS Campaign. The Association collected 196 pounds of food, non-perishable items and monetary donations for the Food Bank. In total, the Association helped provide 2,143 meals for the hungry in Yuma and La Paz counties.
