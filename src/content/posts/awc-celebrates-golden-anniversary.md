In 1963, the community of Yuma County had a dream to give its children an educational future that would be affordable and convenient, and Arizona Western College was born.

The far-sighted community planners, service clubs, parents, educators and local government planted the seeds of education on a barren desert mesa and created the oasis that has richly returned to the community a continual flow of intellectual diversity and inspiration.

AWC is collecting memories and memorializing them to ensure the history of its contributions to the community is preserved. If you are one of the people who has been affected by the college, whether as a student, teacher, parent or member of the community, the College is asking for your participation in collecting these memories and memorabilia into a historical event that will preserve for future generations the experiences that created these past 50 years into a cohesive history that can be passed down to the future.
