Arizona Western College is alerting businesses in the city of Yuma and around Yuma County about an alleged scam involving a marketing company that is using the AWC name and parts of its athletic department to solicit advertising sponsorships and T-shirt sales.

Jam Sports Marketing has contacted at least two Yuma-area businesses within the last two days. According to the businesses, the representative from Jam Sports has offered the business an opportunity to sponsor a T-shirt to raise money for the AWC Cheer Team. Jam Sports has allegedly offered the businesses the chance to put their company logo on a T-shirt that would be thrown into the crowd at Arizona Western College sporting events.

The claims made by Jam Sports Marketing about this T-shirt idea are completely false. Jam Sports Marketing is in no way affiliated with Arizona Western College, the Matador Athletics department, the Matador Athletic Association, the AWC Foundation or the AWC Cheer Team. Jam Sports Marketing is also not authorized to use the Arizona Western College name or logo in any way, shape or form without expressed written consent from Arizona Western College, and have not applied to do so. Any businesses that are contacted by Jam Sports Marketing and told that it is on behalf of Arizona Western College or any of its entities should in no way agree to any sponsorship deals or give out any personal or business information. Any businesses that are contacted by Jam Sports Marketing and told that it is on behalf of Arizona Western College or any of its entities should call Arizona Western College Campus Police immediately at (928) 314-9500.
