More than 80 percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they are 18. Indeed, a majority of Arizona Western Collage adult smokers admit that they have had a habit of smoking since their teenage years.

"I was 18 when I got invited to a birthday party where everybody had a cigarette in their hands," says Sheryl Johnson, 37. "I wanted to fit in and ask my friend to teach me how to smoke."

It's been 19 years now, and Johnson hasn't been able to break the addiction. Anyone who goes into her house or car can smell the tobacco, and it's even on her clothes. But she is so used to it that she can't smell a thing, and it's not something she's proud of.

Every day more AWC students start smoking, often due to stress. They're worried either about grades or about their jobs and families, and that also makes it more difficult to quit smoking.

Unfortunately, smokers are at risk of losing the ability to smell and taste. Smoking at a young age causes their bodies to lose strength and stamina. The nicotine can cause dental problems, too.

"I wouldn't date a smoker again because the last time I did it was an unpleasant experience," says Britney Lopez, 23, a nonsmoker. "Since I have asthma, it was horrible being around him. I couldn't get too close because his breath smelled bad, and I would start panicking because I couldn't breathe."

Some students don't date smokers because of the bad breath and yellow teeth, but most important are the effects of secondhand smoke, which can cause even more damage to the body than smoking itself.

Most students who smoke miss more days of school because they are more prone to colds and the flu as well as other upper-respiratory problems. Also the color of their skin becomes pale or gray.

Some ways to get help with quitting or at least to reducing the addictive effects of smoking are counseling, nicotine patches, nicotine gums and electronic cigarettes. Those who are serious about quitting can also call 1-800-QUIT-NOW for help.
