AWC students enrolled in ceramics, painting, and drawing present several exhibits each year to the campus art gallery. The Yuma Area Art Educators of the community of Yuma, are also given opportunities to share the art gallery.

Professors’ Blomquist and Luna feel the art program at AWC is strong, however if there were changes, students would develop better skills. Our students really need space to make art. An abundance of space would provide larger areas for ceramics, print making, and drawing. Blomquist jokes, “It would be great if we had a giant aircraft hanger.”

Blomquist and Luna not only educate, but also present their achieved works. In September, Professor Blomquist presented the gallery with a painting called the Muse. This particular piece is an assortment of photographs that are printed out and recreated into one large painting. He currently uses Photoshop to bring out composition and the arrangement of form. This painting represents how imagery can work in many different shapes.

Professor Blomquist’s art work has shown up in many places across the United States ranging from Washington, DC, Morgan Stanley, and Purdue University. Some of his work in Washington, DC happened when he was a soldier artist. He was part of a two man team for the US Army Center for Military History. A great deal of history involves soldier art from as far back as Vietnam days.

Blomquist and Luna are constantly in the mix of searching for others qualified to teach. Few classes have opened in San Luis, AZ. “The demand is high and finding qualified faculty is some what of a miracle,” said Blomquist.

Blomquist says he hopes one day they will have paintings in San Luis. The huge population has made it for high demand. Each semester, both professors work with over one-hundred students in studios. Right now they have turned down at least that amount. “Fire code allows fifteen students per studio and we currently allow up to twenty students.

Blomquist leaves students with something to always remember. “A painting or drawing doesn’t have to look like a photograph to be really good. Expression is really important, the feeling itself can make a powerful work of art. It might be more important than the fact that an artist is really good at what he or she really sees.”

Professor Luna teaches ceramics, sculpture, and design. Luna’s work in the gallery offers sculpture. The work presented in the gallery offers safe and secure and boarder monsters. Luna’s work on trying to question politics explains huge impacts on border life and immigration.

The AWC Art Gallery is located within the AB building.
