The area that has been most affected by the development of technology today is the entertainment industry. Halfway through the last century, people started craving a new and more advanced means of entertainment, especially in the United States. So it is, that in 1947 the cathode ray tube amusement device was invented. Since then, video games have turned the world around. Enormous companies have invested billions of dollars to create new and more advanced consoles, getting back hundreds of times their worth in investments and revenues. The video game industry has become one of the most successful markets to invest in.

While ancient video game companies such as Konami, Sega, and Atari, have been practically brushed aside, multinational corporations have taken charge. We see such technology as CD’s, DVD’s and Blue ray, where 20 years ago we could only watch movies via VHS. We also now have MP3s, Ipods, and Zunes, where 25 years ago we only had cassette tapes. But, as sure as you are reading this article, I can say that the area in which the new generation is most gratified is video games.

Not many people know that the company Nintendo started as a developing card club. Now, Nintendo, the corporation, has had the most success, selling almost 600 million consoles worldwide. In 1985, Nintendo launched one of the most successful game consoles ever, the NES. Since then, Nintendo has launched various consoles such as the Supernintendo, N64, and GameCube, without the success of the NES, until they launched the Wii. According to Atomix.vg, a website with the latest video game news, Nintendo is thinking about presenting a new console in March 2010.

Nintendo hasn’t been the only multinational corporation that has been attracted to this area. In 1994, Sony launched the PlayStation, selling 100 million units in 9 years. Also, in 2000 they changed the experience of video gaming by launching the PS2, the bestselling video game console to date, selling 138 million units in less than a decade. However, Sony seems to want more as they released the PS3 in 2006, selling almost 30 million units to date. Giant multinational computer technology corporation Microsoft also wanted a piece of this cake, and in November 2001, they released the XBOX,a powerful and intelligent console, albeit not as popular as the PS2 having sold only 24 for million units, then discontinued in 2008. The XBOX 360, its replacement, from 2005 to date, has sold 39 million units.

According to the Free Encyclopedia, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have sold almost 900 million consoles, crushing other video game companies. These bigger companies are interested in producing better consoles and investing still more money, hoping for greater revenues. There is no doubt that video games have become a very lucrative business.

While the launch of game consoles such as the GameBoy or the NES were focused on children, the newest, best selling games for these consoles are focused on violence and warfare. It could be said that there are different consoles for different ages, yet Nintendo prefers to make more games for children. Sony PlayStation focuses on young adults while Microsoft’s XBOX could be the best option for adults.

As time passes by, we see more violent games that are made for adults rather than kids. This, along with all the money being invested, proves that video games are no longer child’s play.
