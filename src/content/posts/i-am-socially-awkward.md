Growing up, I seemed different from everyone else. I was a quiet kid who created uncomfortable situations for myself.

I was never that great with conversations and many other scenarios. But, hey, am I the only one who is like this?

For example, do you ever finish an exam early before everyone else? I mean, do you have to wait for someone else to turn theirs in?

What do you do when you go to your friend's house and their parents are yelling at them? You pet their dog nervously and pretend as if nothing is happening, of course. Even if they do not have a pet, I will pet their couch if I have to. I have been in this situation countless times.

Now you are in public and you realize that you are walking in the wrong direction. You do not want to look stupid, of course, so you check your phone, let out a sigh and then turn around.

One of the worst situations for me is the famous "Ok class, find a partner" line that professors always use. It is not a good feeling having to make a friend in seconds for a grade, especially when you are one of those quiet types.

I am a polite person, or so I am told. I am one of the few people who will hold the door for other people or help them out in other ways. Nevertheless, nothing is more awkward than opening a door for someone and them being too far away. Having to stand there while they walk those ten feet is pretty nerve racking. I mean, the worst part is probably that some people do not have the decency to thank you.

The worst one, in my opinion, is asking your professor a question and you accidently call her Mom. I have been embarrassed for many things, but this was one of the worst by far. The sad walk back to the seat seems like I am walking across the United States.

I hope that I have made you laugh or at least smile by what I go through every day. I cannot control myself and find it therapeutic to talk about it. I have talked about it before when I have performed standup comedy for the college, but putting it in writing feels better. I feel like I am getting stuff off my chest for your amusement.

The number-one word my friends describe me as is "awkward." It is not really something to be proud of, but I will take that title. What is more awkward than laughing at myself typing this? People around me watching, of course. I am Socially Awkward Now you are in public and you realize that you are walking in the wrong direction.
