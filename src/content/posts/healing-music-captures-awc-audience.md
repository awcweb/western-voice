The healing music of Anton Mizerak and Laura Berryhill came to campus this semester in an event sponsored by the Arizona Western College Massage Therapy Club.

Mizerak, who has traveled the world to learn and perform his music, plays many instruments, including tabla, harmonica, synthesizers and piano. His music and words reflect the influence of his studies in Asia, including Kathmandu, Nepal, where he learned to play the tabla.

Miserak's musical genres encompass healing music, massage music, world music and New Age music. He has performed for and with many well-known artists in these various disciplines. He composes his music in Mount Shasta, where he lives.

Kate Turpin, professor and coordinator of the AWC massage program and advisor of its associated club, said that she has played Mizerak's music for many years during her massage work.

Mizerak weaves storytelling between the notes of his compositions, evoking feelings and emotions while capturing the imagination of his audience. His stories impart the art of living in balance and harmony. It is easy to imagine him in the days before television, sitting in front of a fireplace, sharing his wisdom and music with his community.

In addressing the students in the audience, Mizerak stressed the importance of learning and enjoying what they study. Mizerak explained that "right livelihood" is important to strive for when deciding what to study and what to accomplish in the world.

"Find a way to make money by making people feel good," he advised.

Laura Berryhill accompanied Miserak with her luminous vocals in Gaelic and English and also played bowls, cymbals, shakers, the bodhran (Irish drum) and bells.

Berryhill, who has a Master's degree in music history from the University of Oregon, also works in various musical styles, including early European music, fgolk music of the Celtic cultures, New Age and jazz.

Those who missed this wonderful performance should visit Mizerak's website, www.shastasong.com, with its videos of live performances by Mizerak's and his friends, song downloads and information about where he will be performing. The purchase of a CD will make a serene addition to an enlightened lifestyle.
