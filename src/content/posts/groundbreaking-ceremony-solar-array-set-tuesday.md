Arizona Western College is inviting everyone to the ground breaking ceremony for a first-of-its-kind, landmark Solar Array on Tuesday, May 24, 2011 at 8:00 am. The solar array will provide 100% of the campus electricity, as well as covered parking in the P1 parking lot just outside of the 3C administration building. The ceremony will take place in the parking lot.

Marge Barcomb, president of AWC's District Governing Board, told a press conference held last spring that the solar array is comprised of five million watts using five new technologies from Sol Focus, Skyline, Canadian Solar, Del Solar, and Signet Solar. This comprehensive 5 MW array brings together energy generation, research & education opportunities for science, engineering and biology programs from elementary school through university level, along with innovative cutting-edge test beds for corporate and government research that in turn will provide ongoing resources to the college district. All of this makes this solar array truly unique from other solar arrays in the nation.

The solar array is made possible for AWC with the support of Main Street Power, PPA, APS partners and community leaders. The ground breaking ceremony will include remarks from Dr. Glenn Mayle, President of AWC, Bruce Mercy, CEO of PPA Partners Inc, Julie Engel, President of Greater Yuma Economic Development Corporation, Andrea Bereznak, Community Relations for APS, and Jonathan W. Postal, SVP Business Development for Main Street Power.
