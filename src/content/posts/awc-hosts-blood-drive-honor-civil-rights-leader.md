Help save local lives while learning about Cesar Chavez's Legacy as an American civic leader devoted to improving the quality of life for the farmworker labor community. The annual National Cesar Chavez Blood Drive at AWC will be held at the Schoening Conference Center on Monday, March 26, and Tuesday, March 27 from 10 to 3 p.m.

"The blood stays in Yuma," says Rigoberto Conde, Outreach and Activities Coordinator for the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) at AWC. "The blood collected at the drive is for local usage, to save local lives."

The annual local blood drive, which occurs during National Farmworker Awareness Week and coincides with activities on college campuses throughout the U.S., will feature informational booths on health, safety, community involvement, and Chavez's legacy.

Donors are encouraged to preregister online at bloodhero.org. "There is a benefit to donors for preregistering and keeping that appointment," Conde says. "They will be entered in a drawing for a raffle for fair tickets."

Preregistration will also take place at the cafeteria on main campus on Wednesday, March 22 and Thursday, March 23 from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Invitations to once again participate in the blood drive are being sent to last year's donors as well.
