Dear Campus,

Congratulations to Beverly Shaw, Professor of Nursing, this year's Arizona Western College Teacher of the Year. This distinction includes a scholarship for an outstanding high school student residing within the college district who intends to attend AWC next year, or to a continuing AWC student.

This year Professor Show has decided to split the award and has chosen two AWC continuing students to receive the scholarship. Miguel Martinez is a third-semester nursing student who will receive one semester of tuition and fees, and Monica Acosta is a first-semester nursing student who will receive three semesters of tuition and fees.

Daniel Barajas, Dean of Career and Technical Education, says that Professor Shaw is one of those unique instructors who is extremely dedicated to the nursing profession and is committed to educating our nursing students. Professor Shaw and her student scholarship recipients will be recognized at the Teacher of the Year banquet in April.

Both students were overwhelmed and humbled to be chosen to receive the Beverly Shaw Presidential Teacher of the Year Scholarship award. Tickets for the April 22 Teacher of the Year Banquet can be purchased from Professor of ESL Nancy Blitz.
