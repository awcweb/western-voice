The annual Doctor vs Doctor culinary scholarship fundraiser is being planned to tempt our taste buds on Saturday, March 19 at 5:30 pm in the Schoening Conference Center in the AWC College Community Center (3C).

The fundraiser brings physicians and academic doctors in teams of four to vie for the best taste of the night and Grand Chef title at the Red-Carpet-esque event. The annual event is sponsored by the AWC Foundation, the Foundation of Yuma Regional Medical Center and NAU-Branch Campus.

The event will feature silent and live auctions and tasting of the recipes in a very fun and wildly competitive atmosphere.

Tickets for guests for the fundraiser are $50 per person. For tickets please contact: Jennifer Adair at the AWC Foundation, Jennifer.Adair@azwestern.edu, (928) 344-1720 or Susan Juarez, Yuma Regional Medical Center, sjuarez@yumaregional.org, (928) 336-7346.
