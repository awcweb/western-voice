It is that time of year again to welcome our new and returning students to campus. Over 100 applications from 25 countries have been accepted by our Admissions office, and we are eagerly waiting to hear which ones have received the necessary visa approved by the U.S. Consulate in their countries.

New faces

The International Program is excited to announce the arrival of approximately 20 new international students already this semester from countries around the world -- Vietnam, Canada, Brazil, Serbia, China, Mexico, Cameroun, Netherlands, Australia, Poland and several others. The new students will be joining 34 returning international students.

Included among the newcomers are several student athletes -- men's soccer player Lucas Machado from Brazil, baseball players Liam Wyatt of Canada and Ian Delemarre from the Netherlands, and women's basketball players Katarina Maricic from Serbia and Anne Assena from Cameroun.

We are also pleased to welcome several international freshmen into our Engineering Program -- Duong Nguyen from Vietnam, Luis Quintero from Mexicali, Mex., and Jaime Sanchez from San Luis, Mex.

Befriending an international student is an excellent way to broaden your horizons by learning how different -- and also how similar -- students from different nations and cultural backgrounds are to you. Studying away from home is a challenge due to language barriers, culture shock and that feeling of homesickness.

Take the time to say hello and be helpful to our new international students. Show them what a welcoming place AWC is, and help make their experience here one to remember.

Get involved

This semester the International Program is launching a new program, I AMÖInternational, to promote cultural awareness and understanding. Please keep an eye out for our blue and white I AMÖInternational wristbands. These will be worn by our international students and international affiliates in order to build a sense of community with each other.

There are several opportunities to get involved with the International Program. If interested, you may join our International Club (I-Team). I-Team is open to all international students and all students interested in international topics.

Visit us in Campus Life and ask about the I-Team, Study Abroad opportunities, program events and more. You may contact us at (928) 317 -- 6091 or international.students@azwestern.edu.
