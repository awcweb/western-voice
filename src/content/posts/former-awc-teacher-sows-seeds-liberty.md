Is America still free? Do we live in a democracy? Is the U.S. Government overstepping its Constitutional boundaries? These are the questions that are answered at the Freedom Library. The Freedom Library exists to teach citizens about their rights and liberties directly laid out in the U.S. Constitution, while helping students reach their academic goals with a variety of five $1000 scholarships.

The scholarships are awarded to a student for completion of a series of 12 classes as well as an essay that is due at the end of the semester. They offer three classes per semester. The first two classes are about the U.S. constitution (one is taught in Spanish) and the other class being about Economics. The winner of each receives a $1000 scholarship to the school of the recipient's choice.

The other scholarships are traveling scholarships. These scholarships are given to the recipient who would like to attend a teaching seminar to learn how to facilitate their own Constitution or economic class.

Founder and Librarian

Howard Blitz studied Economics at the University of Arizona and received his bachelor degree in 1970 and his master's degree in 1971. He began teaching Economics full-time at AWC in 1974 through 1976.

"I became interested in what the government was doing, when I turned 18 and had to register for the Draft." Blitz stated. This was the beginning of the years of work that would follow to get to the point where the Freedom Library is today.

His idea for the Freedom Library started when he took his first job at the Bank of Hawaii and started working for Wes Hillendahl. Hillendahl was trustee at the bank but also did a lot of charity work for the Foundation for Economic Education which was founded in 1946 by Leonard Reed. Here is where Blitz started his public work to educate people about economic and constitutional issues.

Today, Blitz can be found working his State Farm Agency helping insure the citizens of Yuma or diligently working in the Freedom Library located behind his business offices.

The Library

The Freedom Library evokes the "Freedom Philosophy" which includes, but is not limited to, the concept of a free market, private property, limited government way of life, and the moral and intellectual principles, which form the basis of a free society. These are the topics of the hundreds of materials that are contained within the Library.

The Freedom Library was founded in 1995 and began teaching the first Constitution class there in 1996. At that time, the library could only offer one $500 scholarship. It has only grown bigger and better from that point to where it is today.

The end of the semester marks the Annual Forum where the Founding Father characters come dressed in full 18th century attire for some fun and announcement of the scholarship winners.

The Freedom Library is an important part of the liberty movement in Yuma. They continue to spread the message and can even be seen in the donation bricks in the pavement outside the AC building on campus.

The materials are available to check out for study. Anyone who wants to know more about the scholarship program, our government, or economic system in general, can contact:
