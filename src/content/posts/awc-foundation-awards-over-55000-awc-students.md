The Foundation of Arizona Western College hosted an event on May 19, allowing the sixty-seven recipients of the 2010-2011 academic school years scholarships to meet their donors. At the event, held at Century Plaza inYuma, some of the gracious donors spoke to the students that were chosen. The AWC Foundation awarded over $55,000 in scholarship funds this month. These students will be attending AWC in the 2010-2011 academic year.

These scholarship funds were donated through generous contributions of area businesses and families. The funds are collected and maintained through the AWC Foundation. The recipients are from high schools around the area and AWC.

The scholarship process begins in the spring semester. Students are required to fill out applications and often write essays. These application packets are then reviewed by a committee and the winners are selected.
