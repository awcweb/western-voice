Having a college degree these days has become increasingly necessary if you intend to stand out in the sea of job applicants. Many jobs that once required only a high school diploma are now rejecting those with a degree. If you've been out of school for a while and are wrestling with the idea of going back for some higher education, consider these reasons:

Job prospects go up with a college degree. Having a degree allows you to seriously consider jobs that you would only be able to dream about without one.

People with college degrees typically earn more than those without.

Your degree validates that you have a skill set in your chosen field and employers won't need to spend resources on training.

When employers see a degree on your resume, regardless of what kind of degree, they recognize the positive qualities of initiative and discipline.

College classes help you to think about things from a new perspective. Being introduced to new ideas and cultures will give you an edge in the workforce as well as encourage your personal growth.

Going to college opens up a whole new networking system. In the job world, it's not always about what you know as much as who you know. People you meet during your college years may give you an "in" when jobs become available in companies they work for.

In general, going to college can only improve your options, your knowledge and your life.
