The Newsletter is designed to share information about the various cultures and literature in the International Program (I-Team) at AWC.

The first four-page issue, edited by Ning Wang, is scheduled to come out in November.

"Newsletter will be a very small newspaper in our campus, it is change for all the international students to publish their articles and share their experience," said Kuntzelman, director of the International Program.

Page 1 will focus on I-Team office news while Page 2 will include student's experiences and shares different cultural stories. The "Special Experience" feature will tell about history and humanity.

"Ning's article brings images and feeling together around deep subjects of interests," said Kuntzelman. "The interesting stories about engineering will tell us physical knowledge about the new technology."

Page 3 will be on I-Team activities, for example the Moon Festival, International Week and Program parties.

"We want every student to have a good way to share their stories," said Kuntzelman.

"We love for students to participate by writing a short article about their experience in the U.S.," said I-Team assistant Sarah M Herman. ëëThis could be something as simple as sharing a recipe for your favorite dish from home."

If some students would like to submit a short article for the Newsletter, you can send an E-mail to the sarah.herman@azwestern.edu before the end of each month.

Earlier editions of the Newsletter were names International Space and Global Voice.

"The newsletter will be the third issue in our international program," said Kuntzelman. "We want it to be better than ever!"
