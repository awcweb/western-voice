The internet is a resource that some people have to use every day so they can do their jobs. But, sometimes the internet can become an addiction; from social networking sites to games and pornography resulting in a great amount of loss and waste.

The social networking sites such as Twitter, MySpace and Facebook, have become big in the past few years. Facebook is a site where you can catch up with your old or new friends, and also play games and quizzes that are always fun. One game in particular that is part of Facebook is Farmville. Farmville is a virtual game where you create your own farmer and plant virtual seeds that include fruits, vegetables, and flowers. By planting these seeds, harvesting them and helping out your neighbors you gain money and experience points that help you raise your level. According to one web site, on April 8 more than 30 million people played this game during a single day. I do play this game from time to time, but for many people it is a true addiction. People seem to either love it or hate it.

Pornography is mostly a taboo word because lots of people don’t like to talk about it. But, it’s out there in the world and we just have to accept the fact. According to another web site, 28,258 people log in to view pornography every second. Every second $3,075.64 is being spent on pornography. Every 39 minutes a new pornographic video is being created in the United States. Every second, 372 internet users are typing adult search terms into a search engine.

What have we turned into? Something in our psyche just seems to get a rush from watching two people have intercourse. If we spend this much money on viewing pornography, no wonder the economy is in a recession.

Addictions often lead to financial, relational, and healthful bankruptcy. But, they are hard habits that can be broken, they aren’t life sentences. We need to try to control ourselves. See your doctor, join a 12 step program, or join another program. There are several options available to those who are willing to quit.
