Arizona Western College is inviting everyone to two free presentations given by Professor Angel Luna and Dr. Charles Tatum in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month on Monday October 17, Tuesday October 18 and Monday October 24 in San Luis and on the main campus.

The first visual presentation, The Love of the Laborer, is by Art Professor Angel O. Luna as he tells stories and reflects on growing up in a family of field laborers to becoming a professor at AWC today. He will cover the historical references of Chicano worker artwork and images of his family that influenced him to create his current bodies of artwork in the gente not numbers series and the border monster series.

Dr. Charles Tatum will provide the second presentation called Chicano Popular Culture.

Most Americans, regardless of class, race, ethnicity, national origin, or gender, are exposed daily to heavy doses of popular culture in the form of television and radio programming, cinema, and advertising. Americans of Mexican descent bring a rich history and deep appreciation of popular cultural practices to American society. This presentation will explore these practices thriving today, including the oral tradition (corridos, folk tales, riddles and popular sayings); television; radio; newspapers; cinema; sports; civil, secular and religious celebrations; music and popular literature. Audiences will become more familiar with the history, roots, traditions, values, attitudes and social life of the fastest growing segment of our population.
