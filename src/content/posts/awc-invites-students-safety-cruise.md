Every year thousands of college students participate in some type of spring break activity whether it is in a tropical climate, a ski trip or a road trip. Due to the fact that some students may be tempted to engage in high-risk behavior during this time, Arizona Western College will be providing our students with information that will ensure their spring break is a success.

Arizona Western College's faculty, staff and students want spring break trips to be fun and as safe as possible. So, the campus community is invited to join us on March 14th from 10am-2pm on the main campus at the Eatery and the surrounding outside area for fun and games and a great raffle. Raffle prizes will be awarded to those participating in the 'island' themed booth activities.

Participants will navigate thru the 'waters' to visit several educational 'ports' ranging from safe sex at the Virgin Island port, alcohol safety at Rum Island, skin safety at Bikini Island (which is a real island in the Marshall Islands). New islands added this year will include: 'Pot Island' where marijuana and its health implications and legal issues are discussed and 'Lunga Island" where students and Yuma County Health Department will participate in demonstrating the benefits of a smoke-free campus and 'Volcano Island' for the Lesbian-Gay- Bisexual -Transgender and Questioning [LGTBQ] Club to address community issues. Former favorite 'islands' will also cover nutritional safety at Cook Island, Port Galapagos will have interacting with travel safety issues; and 'safe harbor' is available to discuss violence prevention.

So those participating need to have passports out and ready to come aboard for some interactive learning, good friends, food and treats as they learn spring break safety. For more information contact AWC's Health Services at 928-344-7602.
