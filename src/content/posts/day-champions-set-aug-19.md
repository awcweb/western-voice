The 7thAnnual AWC Day of Champions takes place this Friday, August 19th. Nearly 200 AWC players, coaches, and staff and will volunteer in the community for six hours, helping out various organizations-including Habitat for Humanity, Amberly’s Place, Crossroads Mission, Yuma Community Food Bank, Salvation Army, Girl Scouts of America and the Imperial Valley Red Cross.

This year, AWC’s volunteers will be joined by the support of over 150 volunteers from Yuma’s 4 Wal-Mart stores, Sam’s Club, Outback Steakhouse, Southwest Gas, Pepsi-Cola of Yuma, SportsRadio 560 KBLU, Star 100.9 FM and FM 95.1 KTTI. In addition, Wal-Mart & Sam’s Club will provide breakfast for all volunteers. Pepsi-Cola of Yuma will provide drinks for the volunteers throughout the day, Southwest Gas will provide equipment, and the event will culminate at Outback Steakhouse, who will provide lunch for all of the volunteers at the day’s conclusion.

The volunteers dig in every year to complete community projects for non-profit agencies throughout Yuma, Wellton, Somerton, San Luis, the Foothills and El Centro, California “There are times early in the morning when we wonder whether or not things will come together, but it doesn’t take long before it all falls into place,” said AWC Athletic Director Jerry Smith. “Every part of the process has become such a collaborative effort between so many organizations. By the time everyone gathers in the gym the morning of the event to find out what job they have, they’re all so ready to help out the people in our community that need it. That’s why we get a little more efficient every year.” Smith added that last year was the first time in the six-year history of the event that all of the 35 tasks were completed before noon.
