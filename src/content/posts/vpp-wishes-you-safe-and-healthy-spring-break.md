The Violence Prevention Program (VPP) and Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) have been active these past few weeks in various Arizona Western College activities, from the Transfer Fair here on the main campus to visits to the La Paz County campuses.

These groups have been spreading the word about healthy relationships and about the program that is here to assist those students who are going through any type of relationship violence -- not just not physical, but also emotional, verbal, and sexual violence, as well as stalking.

The VPP and MVP Club wants to remind all students and faculty to have a safe Spring Break. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

Always know your resources wherever you go, such as police and emergency personnel.

Always be accompanied by a person you know such as a friend or a family member.

Don't confuse lust with love.

Don't drink and drive.

You are criminally responsible if you have sexual relations with someone who is under the influence of any substance or impaired in any way that would affect their ability to make a decision regarding their personal safety and welfare.

Remember, the VPP is here to for you, and it is here to help.
