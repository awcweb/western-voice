Support your local Vets

You sit next to them in class. The barista at the campus Starbucks might be one, even your college roommate.

Veterans – the people who volunteered knowing they might have to give their life for our freedom. Once they finish active duty they get the opportunity to go back to school and start another chapter in their lives.

November 18 was everyone’s chance to give back and do a little exercise at the Fourth Annual Freedom Run, Walk and Roll 5K. The event took place at Charlie Dine Softball Field.

All registration fees will benefit the AWC Patriots Gold Heart Fund. Medals were awarded to the first three finishers.

“Arizona Western College is deemed a Veteran Supportive Campus, a designation granted by the Arizona Department of Veterans’ Services,” said Coordinator of Veteran Services Gabriela Siqueiros-Herwig. “We are also a Principles of Excellence campus and are a part of the 8 Keys to Veterans Success.”

According to the U.S. Department of Education website, “The 8 Keys to Veterans’ Success are steps that postsecondary institutions can take to assist veterans and active service members in transitioning to higher education, completing their college programs and obtaining career-ready skills.”

More information on the 8 Keys can be found at https://www.ed.gov/veterans-and-military-families/8-keys-success-sites.

“Veterans and their family members need us to support them when they are integrated back into society,” said Siqueiros-Herwig. “At AWC, we don’t just help them to obtain their education. We connect them to our local community service providers, so they are successful in all areas of life.”

The Patriots Gold Heart Fund was created to help veterans where other benefits do not. Siqueiros-Herwig spoke about veterans who lacked necessities – books, paper and even parts to get their vehicles going again. A simple form and approval, and veterans are on their way to success.

Among the many individuals and groups who supported the event were: Aybuke Keehn, AWC coordinator of International Students Program; Renee Smith, director of Institutional Advancement for the AWC Foundation; Dr. Daniel P. Corr, AWC President; Rebecca Drabent, employer and community relations partner at Goodwill of Central and Northern Arizona; Laura Sandigo, director of Diversity, Inclusion & AccessABILITY; the AWC Marketing & Publications team; Team Red, White & Blue (Yuma); YPG Color Guard; Joseph Lasky of the Vet Center; musician Brian Claar; and of course the AWC Veteran Services staff.

Even if you didn’t make it to the Freedom Run, you can still thank a veteran for protecting us and keeping America free.
