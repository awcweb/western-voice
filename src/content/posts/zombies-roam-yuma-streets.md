Coverage of destruction in Yuma after invaded by ZOMBIES!!!

April 1, 2021: The City of Yuma, Arizona, is being held hostage by the walking dead. The few surviving citizens must hide in order to keep their flesh from being torn apart and becoming a meal.

Those who have survived, however, do not seem normal. Consistently, seventy-two hours after a person is bitten, they die. Quickly they reanimate into creatures with blood-shot eyes, ghost-like skin and a craving for flesh.

Who would have guessed that our town would be the one to turn the rest of the world upside down?

These ghoulish creatures roam the streets in a hunger search from what used to be the Yuma Palms to where Hooligan's sat. The night life is scary, empty, and silent except for the occasional faint scream of a human being from far away.

There are no clubs open now, no college students driving around aimlessly searching for the new "hot-spot," everything seems vacant without any sign that their used to be life.

Beginning of the End

From the loss of jobs, the climate continually getting hotter each year and drug usage at an all time high, slowly but surely Yuma began deteriorating in 2010. Some called it a curse at the beginning of the century, but who really knows what happened?

The week the outbreak began, locals tried desperately to flee Arizona, hoping this chaos would end or at least deflate. However, they where quickly turned away and forcibly sent home by some secret government organization.

News of what was taking place in Yuma was not broadcasted on any mainstream news network. The terror reigning in our town was covered up. Nobody in the outside world knew of the living dead running around and tearing the living apart.

Arizona simply disappeared to the outside world.

The same organization which neglected the townspeople boarded up the state of Arizona in a matter of weeks. Steel bars and wire fences as high as eighteen-feet surround us; all guarded by outside authority.

Outside people who have tried to come in have failed. They have all been turned away. If there is an objection, rights are taken away- thanks to the president of today. This communist in disguise has been in search of a cure by experimenting with the dead, as well as the living.

Get ready, set, run!

Media cover-up prevented 80 percent of outsiders to see anything wrong in this apocalypse we face.

The sunsets that used to be seen off the Ocean to Ocean bridge aren't of orange and purple anymore, they are all shades of grey. Even when the day is bright, not a single living soul is out wandering or playing in the parks which used to echo with the laughter of children.

Yuma has become a gore fest. Decaying flesh and body parts are scattered throughout the town. Signs of struggle between the living and the dead are everywhere.

Running, growling, the noise of breaking and flesh being eating are common noises now. Not a single warm smile ever comes across the faces of the people in this town, the forgotten ones.

Nowadays who cares if anybody speaks English perfectly or is a fluent Spanish speaker. The survivors remain quiet to keep a step ahead of the undead. Since there is no where to go and survivors are being killed or are giving up, this could be Yuma's demise.

How will people know about the history of this town when it is being ruled by creatures that are just out for blood? What sets this town apart from any other town out there in the world? Do the townspeople now regret not cherishing their history? What will become of the culture this town is established on?

The zombies' human features are still there today in the year 2021, but don't get close- they BITE!
