James McNeill has submitted several pictures of the activities going on during homecoming week at Arizona Western College this past week. The 2011 Homecoming Queen and King are Alma Mendoza and Egar Bettencourt.

Edgar Joao Bettencourt was born in 1989 in the city of Odessa, Ukraine. Son to a Cabo Verdian Father and a Mongolian Mother, Edgar considers himself to be a multicultural person. He moved to the Islands of Cape Verde when he was 2 and lived there until he was 10. After that he moved to Mongolia until 2010 when he decided to study in Yuma. Edgar is a business major, planning on getting a bachelors degree in International Economics and hopefully become an International businessman. Edgar loves dancing more than anything and soccer is his favorite sport.

Alma Yaryzett Mendoza was born in Orange County, CA, but raised in Yuma for 17 years. Alma has always had an interest in becoming an actress/psychologist and has the determination to make this happen. Alma is seeking a degree in Theatre. Alma says that optimism is her strongest characteristic. She tries to live everyday by Ellen DeGeneres' motto: Be kind to one another.

The Homecoming game against Pima was an exciting finale for a great week with a 58-14 win.

Here is the collage for your enjoyment.
