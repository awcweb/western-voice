If you're not already registered for the Fall semester, here's a class I recommend you take -- Stress Management with Professor Susan Hejhal. And if you think that it sounds boring, you couldn't be more wrong.

I first heard about this class from my friend who took it last fall. I thought it was funny at first, especially when she told me they just got done playing a game of tag, but I decided to take it anyway.

Yes, the class requires you to follow certain AWC guidelines. So, at first Professor Hejhal explains what causes stress and how it affects you. Stress can kill you or even shorten your life when sometimes all you need is the simplest of remedies, breathing. Once you get through the basics you begin to do stuff like game night or kickball, followed by a game of nerf tag.

It is also the easiest A ever; just participate and do weekly journals. The whole point of the class is to help you learn how to relax and maybe lengthen your lifespan a little, not add to the ever-growing stress of being a student. Sometimes, you just have to stop worrying about what people think and rejoice in the fact that you get to chase your classmates around with a nerf gun.

If I have completely failed to convince you to take this class or you just don't have the time, here are 10 easy tips to ease stress on your own:

1. Breathe. Yep, that's right. Sometimes all you need to do is take several deep breaths.

2. Get some friends together and play some childhood games like tag or kickball.

3. Laugh, a lot. Try not to take everything so seriously; there is a lot of humor in human, and even mechanical, errors. Take them as opportunities to let loose with a giggle. Unless, of course, your boss just smashed his finger in a drawer.

4. Borrow a coloring book. It may seem childish, but you focus so much on the coloring that everything else fades away.

5. Set aside some much-needed "me time" at least once a week. The most relaxing thing would probably be a bubble bath, but that's just my opinion.

6. Take a long walk. Nature can be very relaxing under the right circumstances.

7. Sit outside and meditate. If you have a journal handy, write everything you see; but try not to be too formal. Free verse can help you dump all the negative baggage.

8. Start up yoga. Among other things, it teaches helpful breathing techniques.

9. Start eating healthy. The healthier the body, the better for you in the long run.

10. Lastly, get in tune with your creative side. Arts and crafts keep you focused. If you already have a hobby, set aside more time for it.
