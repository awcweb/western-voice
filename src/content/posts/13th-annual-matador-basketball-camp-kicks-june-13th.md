Arizona Western College is proud to announce the expanded 13th Annual Matador Basketball Camp which includes two different weeks of opportunities for kids to better their basketball skills from some of the top coaches and players in the area. Session 1 will be held from June 13th through the 16th, and Session 2 will be held from June 20th through the 23rd. Both sessions will be held at 'The House'-AWC's gymnasium (2020 South Avenue 8E in Yuma). The camp will be run by AWC Men's Head Basketball Coach Charles Harral, assistant coaches Carter Roe and Jim Amick as well as current and former Matador Basketball players. Campers will each receive a free AWC camp basketball and T-shirt.

The first week of the camp-known as Session 1-is the half-day version, and it's open to all boys and girls between the ages of 7 and 18 years of age. The morning session is for kids ages 7-11, and will run each of the four days from 9AM until noon. The afternoon session will be for kids ages 12-18 and will run from 1-4PM each day. Registration for the first week will start on June 13th at 8:30AM Monday for the morning session and 12:30PM for the afternoon session at 'The House'. Campers will be instructed on the various fundamentals of basketball, including dribbling, shooting and defense. There will be fundamental teaching stations as well as shooting games that will be held throughout the camp. The cost for each camper for Session 1 is $75.

The second week-known as Session 2-will be an expanded version this year. It's open for kids ages 7-18 and will run from 9AM until 9PM June 20th through the 23rd. Lunch & dinner will be provided each day. Overnight residence will also be offered that week (for an extra $50) for campers who would like to stay securely in the college residence halls (breakfast will also be provided for those campers). The cost (not including overnight residence) for Session 2 is $200 per camper. Registration for that week will be held on Monday, June 20th at 8:30AM at 'The House' on the AWC campus.

Those rates are available on the men's basketball page of the AWC Athletics website (www.azwestern.edu/athletics). A camp flyer is also available for download on the same page. Camp registration will be on a first-come, first-served basis, and the registration form along with a required $50 non-refundable deposit is due to the AWC Men's Basketball Office by June 1st.
