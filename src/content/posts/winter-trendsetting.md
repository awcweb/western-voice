Winter is finally here! It is time to put away the bathing suit and shorts and pull out those trendy coats, scarves, and boots! If you are not aware of what is in style this season as far as clothing, makeup and hair, not to worry, there are many ideas to choose from by browsing through the Winter collections held at your favorite clothing store. Here are some tips which will help you discover your inner rock star.

Many places in town to shop hold a broad selection of the latest fashions at reasonable prices, such as the Yuma Palms Shopping Center, Burlington Coat Factory, DD's Discounts, Faci, and Red Zone. You don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money to try to look like your favorite celebrity. Many pieces to choose from resemble Rihanna without breaking the bank.

The most popular pieces out there right now would have to be the knitted hats and the Ugg boots. The more accessories the better! It is Winter, so you can bundle up as much as you want and still look good. If you choose to wear a knee-high skirt with boots, leggings would be a great factor in this ensemble. It is too cold to be bare-legged anyway, and this set looks good with mid-calf boots.

Another fact about Winter fashion is that you can get away with darker eye makeup. Try using the "smokey-eye" effect with your darker clothing; the more intense your eyes look, the edgier the look you will achieve. This is your chance to pull out the darker lip- sticks. Be brave and try the deep reds, but be sure your skin color matches the lip color. If your skin is quite fair, then you can use a medium to light red. Anything too dark will make your skin color appear lighter than it actually is. If you have a medium to dark complexion, you are free to use the darker colors.

Hair color is a perennial debate. Depending on the season, the hair color would want to be changed as well. In the Summer, most women like to highlight their hair and use lighter, funnier colors. In the winter, many women like to color their hair darker because their makeup and accessories are darker. If you have fair skin, you may want to avoid dark hair color which can make your skin look lighter than it actually is.

Good luck and simply have fun making yourself over this winter!
