Nothing can ruin plans for the future like an unwanted pregnancy. That's why Yuma Planned Parenthood offers free assistance to male and female students who don't have any insurance.

"I had planned to go to college when I was younger," said one thirty-one year old woman preferring to remain anonymous, "I wanted to be a conservationist and spend my life traveling the country, working at different national parks. I even saved two thousand dollars for the tuition, but then I got pregnant right after I turned eighteen. All my money went on diapers and formula instead and I've never even got to see the Grand Canyon, yet!"

According to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute in New York more than half of all pregnancies in 29 states and the District of Columbia were unintended; 38 percent to 50 percent were unintended in the remaining states. The highest numbers come from Mississippi and large urban populations, while the smallest numbers come from New Hampshire. The major reason given for not using birth control methods was a lack of preventative care. Another common reason was denial; no one thinks it will happen to them.

"I don't regret having the baby," the woman continued, "but life would have been a lot different for me if I had been more responsible back then. I just didn't really think it was something I had to worry about."

Yuma Planned Parenthood also assists men and women with abortion, STD's, body image, pregnancy and other sexual health care needs.
