The NBA playoffs go back to before I was born and this year has been my favorite so far. I saymy favoritebecause of the West Coast matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Oklahoma Thunder, as well as the East Coast rivalry between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls. The West games aren’t turning out the way critics want them to and the East is barely meeting expectations, so the Playoffs are something you don’t want to miss!

LA Lakers vs. Oklahoma Thunder:

Many believed this series to be a blow-out on the Thunder, considering they are playing the defending champions. But, the Thunder had different plans. They have been showing their obvious advantage over the Lakers by using their running game and young legs to run the Lakers out of the gym.

Even though they lost the first two games in Los Angeles, you could tell by the low score that the tables were about to turn in favor of the Thunder. In the first game, the Thunder was a bit jolted and unprepared for the Lakers, which showed in the score, 87-79 Lakers. However, in the second game the Thunder used their knowledge of the Lakers’ offense and defense to cut the deficit. Although it wasn’t enough in the end (95-92 Lakers), they were coming closer to the “champion” Lakers then most predicted.

Then, when returning home with new confidence and a familiarity with the Lakers, they seemed to figure out every play the Lakers could make. Los Angeles had no answer for Durant, not even from their superstar Bryant. He couldn’t prevent the Thunder’s victory of 101-96. And winning once wasn’t enough; the Thunder came out with a vengeance the fourth game as if they were down in the series 3-0. They showed the Lakers no mercy in their attack and completely demolished them in a score of 110-89. This shows that the Thunder now know the Lakers game and will continue with the series coming out on top.

Most say that these wins were simply the home court advantage at its best, but I would disagree. One cannot deny the quality of the Thunder. They are a younger and faster team and they executed their type of game well in the third and fourth game. Although inexperienced compared to the Lakers, they do have the advantage of not knowing how to lose a series or how to fear a team due to not being in this situation before. Also, they have the advantage of age. Don’t get me wrong; nothing is wrong with the veteran Lakers. They know the game very well and know how to execute with precision. However, with the speed and adrenaline of the fresh young Thunder, the Lakers veteran status goes out the window. There is no advantage in knowing how to stop the defense if you simply cannot keep up with them. That isn’t something you can teach. Sorry, but father time is just not on the Lakers’ side.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Chicago Bulls:

Just like the Lakers-Thunder series, this was also said to be a blow-out with the Cavs on top due to the unstoppable force that is Lebron James; but the Bulls have put up a fight. This series has actually come out to be more interesting than predicted. Derrick Rose has actually put some scrap into the Bulls and didn’t just let them lie down. But, Lebron and the Cavs have only given the Bulls one game and, sadly, I believe that is all they will get. The sportscasters have commented on Lebron’s skills; his intense focus and heightened talent, as well as his ability to transfer that to his team. With that kind of leadership, I don’t see the Cavs falling to the Bulls, or any team to come.
