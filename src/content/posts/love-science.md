Call me sentimental, I don’t care, but I love nature, dirt, rocks, plants, everything. I love gardening, collecting rocks, 4-wheeling into the backwoods, or just climbing a tree to check out the view below. Birds and trickling waterfalls are nature’s music and fruit and nuts are her candy. I guess that’s why AWC science classes were some of my favorites.

Our Science professors love to go on field trips to get their students dirty and I can wallow in the mud with the best of them. If you love studying nature, planting trees or canoeing, then Environmental Science will meet all of your wants and needs. If you love rocks and geological history,

Geology class is the answer. I was just a van driver for this class, but it was so interesting I followed them all over the mountains and valleys. Plant Sciences is just the thing for anyone who loves gardening or field work. And then, of course, there are the new solar tech classes. It is so exciting being on the leading edge of solar technology in the nation! How awesome is that?

Yes, we have a great Science program here and it’s getting better all the time. If you would like to be one of those individuals who can make a difference in the world , this is a great place to start.

“One of the penalties of an ecological education,” says Aldo Leopold in his book, A Sand County Almanac, (one of my all time favorites) “is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.”

I don’t know about anyone else, but I take that statement as a direct challenge. Yes, knowledge can be a sad thing sometimes, but the more people who stand on the road torecovery, the better our chances for a cleaner, healthier, better future. After all, “a conservationist,” Aldo also states in the same book, “is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke [of the axe] he is writing his signature on the face of the land.” More humility is what our world needs if we are to save it.
