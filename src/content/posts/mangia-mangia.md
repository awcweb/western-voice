Imagine yourself basking in the warm Italian sun, surrounded by stunning architecture and cobblestone streets, sampling some of the worldâ€™s finest cuisine.

The Desert Culinary Club of Arizona Western College is hoping to find themselves enjoying this scene next year. The club is holding numerous events and dinners throughout the year in the hopes of raising the necessary funds for the trip.

Every other Tuesday, the Club will hold seven-course gourmet dinners that are open to the public. The next dinners will be Oct. 16 and 30 at 6:00 pm. The $25 tickets can be purchased at the business office in the 3C Building.

The Club will also be offering a bake sale on Halloween and pie sales at Thanksgiving, and it also will have a cookbook on sale by Thanksgiving.
