For as little as $2.50 with a student ID, or $5 without one, you can watch award winning independent films the 1st Thursday of every month at Thursday at the Theatre in Yuma's Historic Art Theatre on Main St. Due to spring break last week, however, the April film will be showing Thursday night, April 12.

The show begins at 7 PM, but a long line of people has usually already formed when the doors open at 6:30 so they have plenty of time to get their $2 bags of popcorn, $2 sodas and a good seat.

At 7:00, Professor Michael Miller stands up and introduces the audience to the feature film and gives us a synopsis and review with any warnings, if necessary, to nudity or excessive violence, so we will know what to expect.

He also tells us a little about the award-winning short film, usually 10-15 minutes, that we watch prior to the feature.

After both films, interested viewers are welcome to stay and join Professor Miller's film class to discuss and critic the films..

Synopsis

This true story of the infamous Bast¯y Boys Home correctional facility in Norway, begins with the arrival of seventeen-year-old Erling, a rumored murderer. He immediately clashes with the island facility's governor (Stellan SkarsgÂrd), who believes manual labor, rigid discipline, and harsh punishment are the only methods that can turn the boys into honorable members of society. Refusing to accept the constant abuse, Erling slowly rouses the rest of the boys out of their resigned existence, and encourages them to fight to lift up their spirits. When tragedy finally falls at the hand of the sadistic dorm master, Erling leads his comrades in a courageous and vicious rebellion that will bring them head to head with no less than the Norwegian Army.
