An original recipe by Alejandro Garza

Prep time: 10 min

Yield: 2 quarts

Heat: Medium to High

1. 2 cans of whole tomatoes (15 oz.)

2. 1 can of water (use tomato can)

3. 1 can of yellow El Pato (7oz)

4. 1 or 2 fresh jalapeno either fried, baked, or grilled

5. 1/8 c lime juice

6. a quarter c garlic powder

7. 2 tsp. salt

8. 2 tsp. pepper

9. 1 can of Rotel reg/medium/hot (10oz)

10. 1 onion minced

11. 1 bushel of fresh cilantro chopped

Directions: Chop onions and cilantro, cut stems off of cilantro set aside. In a blender, puree the first 8 ingredients (depending on the size of the blender, you may need to divide) plus the cilantro stems (this is optional but it adds taste) about 20-30 seconds, making sure it's well blended. Then place the puree in a bowl, add Rotel, chopped onions and cilantro and stir. Season with more salt, pepper and garlic to taste.
