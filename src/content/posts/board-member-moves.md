District Governing Board member JoAnne Ehasz has announced her resignation from the Board due to relocation. Ehasz was appointed one year ago by Janice Shelton, La Paz County Superintendent of Education, to fill the unexpired term of Randy Hartless. That position was scheduled to be on the ballot in November 2014.

Ehasz capably represented La Paz District 1 (Parker, Poston, Bouse, Cibola and Ehrenberg precincts) but is now relocating to another part of the state due to her husband's job change.

A media release was sent announcing that interested candidates could file with the La Paz County Superintendent to be placed on the ballot for the November election. The successful candidate will take office in January 2015.

We deeply appreciate Ehasz's service to the College and wish her well.
