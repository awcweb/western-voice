Music, chatting and news are what you usually expect to hear when you turn on the radio, and our college's KAWC FM Radio Station is no different. Although the station has had a certain specialized demographic of listeners, it's about to unleash a new wave of entertainment to its schedule.

Specifically, Arizona Western College's own Alex Ortega will be the first student in quite a while to get the chance to start his own show on KAWC.

"I want it to be a hit. I want it to be different from everything else they've been doing," Ortega said. "Since it's a college, I want it to relate back to the student interest."

The 24-year-old Georgia native has been in Yuma for a year and is majoring in Media Arts. He's been working at KAWC for about 10 months at jobs that include ripping music from CDs and making promos, 30-second segments and replacement fillers.

After two shows were knocked off the station's schedule, Ortega made an initial mockup of his show, but it was shot down by his bosses. A couple of days later, though, the show was given a green light, and he couldn't be any more excited and happy.

This experience puts everything into perspective because he initially saw himself doing sound production, and not necessarily radio.

If you're a fan of Chris Hardwick's @midnight show on Comedy Central, you'll be a fan of Ortega's show. Since the show is still in the beginning stages, its name is still up in the air, but Ortega is leaning toward Trending Tonight.

His vision of the show is to speak about things that are trending and current. The information can come from social media, entertainment or events happening on campus. It won't be typical news, though, because it will also talk about trending music.

The two-hour time slot will be musically driven with new discoveries of bands and of music relating back to a specific time -- for instance, the anniversary of an album or song.

As of now, he is the forced behind the show in terms of recording and production, but he will eventually have guests. Three concepts he wants people to think of when listening to his show are that it's current, entertaining and musically diverse.

He admits that gathering information and researching is time consuming, and looking through music files is a difficult aspect of preproduction. In addition, learning different systems at the station can make someone's head spin, but he's eager to get the show filling people's eardrums.

Ortega anticipates leaving the Yuma area in a year or so, but he hopes to pass the show down to another prodigy to continue the momentum of student involvement.

Ortega's show will be hitting the airways on Fridays in either early December, or else after the holidays in January.

It's been a long time since a student has had the privilege of having his own show on KAWC, and now that Ortega is getting a shiny silver mic, it's definitely worth giving a listen.

"I know I was working my butt off, and it paid off," Ortega said.
