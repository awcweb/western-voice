For this year's Breast Cancer Awareness Walk, dozens of Arizona Western College students and staff came together to show their support regarding this important subject.

The bright pink tents were set up outside the Eatery on the morning of Oct. 23, their crews handing out pamphlets and information to anyone who came and asked questions. T-shirts were given out to the first 50 students who showed up for the walk, which began at noon.

Tanya Thompson, an X-ray technician from Yuma Regional Medical Center, was there giving helpful advice.

"One in eight women develop breast cancer, and we don't know what causes it," said Thompson. "That's why it's important to stay aware."

All the credit goes to Campus Life for putting this life-learning experience together in the interest of raising public awareness.

"It's a good cause," said Alexis Romero, one of the student volunteers. "It's amazing to see our AWC community come together to support breast cancer awareness."

Once again, the campus family was able to come together and show support for a great cause.
