Only one professor can take on the job of Honors Director at Arizona Western College and implement his love of botany by cultivating a new crop of Honors students and helping them blossom. That professor is none other than Ted Martinez.

Being a member of the AWC faculty since January 2005, Martinez is no stranger to the campus. Having some experience with Honors students and events, he was excited to take on this opportunity.

Martinez started out teaching a few Biology classes and is now a professor for Biology, Environmental Science and Identification of Arizona Native Plants for AWC. He also teaches some Northern Arizona University higher-level courses such as Economic and Applied Botany. Now that he has taken on the director role of the Honors Program, he also teaches the required Honors Seminar courses.

Martinez feels prepared taking on this position since he has been around honors and has worked with previous directors.

"I've been on the Honors Council and have had exposure to the program," Martinez said. "I actually like working one on one with students."

Upping the intellectual ante

One of his goals for the program is to start a new project related to his science expertise. This project involves the Honors students growing and selling plants.

"I'd like to do some high-profile events on campus," said Martinez. "I'd like to have the first plant sale that Arizona Western College has ever had. I think that Honors could be the driving force for that."

Honors students in the required Seminar course will begin to grow the plants this fall on campus in the greenhouse. Then, in the spring semester, they will sell the plants to students, faculty and the public. The funds will benefit events or the Phi Theta Kappa honor society, which he advises.

Martinez also plans on changing up the curriculum for the spring semester by formally adding some training on undergraduate research and presentation skills; essential skill sets that they can take with them to universities if they plan to transfer.

"I like the idea of research because it is so important at the junior and senior level," said Martinez. "As the students go on, they are going to be asked to do more and more independent research by the faculty, especially at the university level."

Greater Visibility

Overall, Martinez hopes to bring visibility to the program and make an impact on campus. He plans on doing some extra-curricular activities, outings and field trips appropriate to the program and hopefully appeal to prospective Honors students.

"Your chances for success really go up when you get into a program like this," said Martinez. "I think [students] will have more fun and a better college experience."

Martinez would like to welcome any Honors students, students interested in Honors or visitors to come and see the Honors Center located in the Learning Resources Building, Room 86. The Center allows people to use computers, study, do homework or meet with friends. It is open Monday through Thursday usually between 11a.m. and 4:30 p.m.

Anyone with questions regarding the program is encouraged to make an appointment by calling the Honors Center at (928) 344-7685 or by sending an e-mail to ted.martinez@azwestern.edu.
