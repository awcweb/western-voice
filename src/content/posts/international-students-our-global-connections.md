AWC International Programs attract students from around the world.Yuma and AWC have a rich cultural diversity and significant international population. Students from more than 30 countries make up nearly 8 percent of our enrollment. This semester we have 52 international students from 17 countries here on temporary student visas (F1). About one third (17) of our international students participate in sports, 5 of them belong to the Honors Program and 5 work as math and science tutors at the Student Success Center.

International students make up the majority of members in the AWC i-Team, a student club devoted to appreciating, sharing, and understanding different cultures and learning about International issues at their weekly meetings. The iTeam meets on Tuesdays at 4 p.m. near the Campus Life area of the 3C Building. This growing club is planning several activities and field trips, and it welcomes all students.

Anyone interested in connecting with students with international interests can do so on Facebook (AWC International Students) or follow us on Twitter @AWC_IntProgram.

Finally, several students from Yuma County are looking toward Education Abroad opportunities next summer in England, Portugal and Spain, among other countries. There are many programs for Study Abroad and tremendous new opportunities developing for Volunteer Service Abroad. Scholarships are available. Contact the International Office (317-6091) for more information.
