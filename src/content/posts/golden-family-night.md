We are excited to announce that we are expanding our event to include an academic open house component. The idea and vision is to showcase our degrees and certificates along with Career and Technology programs. Student Services will be participating by hosting activities, promoting departments, club and organizations.We will have food options, entertainment and activities for college level and beyond.Potentially each program can have a student component (club), faculty component (degree or certificate) and then the community partner/vendor showcasing possible employment opportunities!Here is the link for the registration form. Please have your departments complete and submit and we will follow up.http://www.azwestern.edu/student_services/campus_life/family_night_form....In addition to being fun this is a great way to promote all the wonderful work we are doing here at AWC!We look forward to seeing all of at the 13th annual√ñ.
