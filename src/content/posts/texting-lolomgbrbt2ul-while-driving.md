The controversy began with cell phones and music causing accidents while driving. Now, texting is blamed for distractions as well. States across the country have already banned texting while driving. Is Arizona next?

In Summer 2009, the Arizona Senate voted down a bill to ban text messaging. Should driving while using cell phones be illegal? Every year more accidents are being caused because people are taking their attention off the road while texting or talking.

We all know that driving drunk impairs your driving, but doesn’t texting do the same? Some people believe there should be exceptions, while others do not. “Cell phones cause reckless moves,” stated Yuma resident Joseph Mitchell. “Ban them from driving completely, or at least pull over to talk or text.”

High school student Christina McCafferty says,” Yes, it should be banned. I think it should have punishments as strict as DUI because it has caused so many accidents and deaths.”

Former AWC student Jasmine Arturo disagrees. “Cell phones shouldn’t be banned completely because sometimes we get lost or have an emergency and need them, but we shouldn’t be texting.”

Already numerous states have banned texting/cell phone usage while driving. City of Phoenix drivers are already prohibited from text messaging. Senator Al Melvin, R-Tucson, vows to try again with the text messaging ban in all of Arizona beginning Jan. 11, 2010 after being denied last summer.

We all have our own opinions on text/cell phone use while driving. What’s your opinion? Should it be banned?
