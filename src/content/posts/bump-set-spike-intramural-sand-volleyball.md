In November, sand volleyball was the Intramural Sports Program sport of the month at Arizona Western College. Games were played on Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. in the "quad" of the Residence Halls. Teams were organized among the students who showed up to play. As an added bonus, those who came on the last Tuesday of the month earned a special Andale intramural T-shirt.

Jennifer Tagaban, coordinator of Residence Life said that the intramural program received lots of positive feedback during the semester. For September's featured sport, dodge ball, students dodged, ducked, dipped and dove their way through the organized chaos of dozens of balls hurling through the air. October drew a large crowd of intense soccer players as "The House" was transformed into an indoor soccer arena.

Sand volleyball received rave reviews from those who attended. Brianna Hughes feels that it was the best intramural sport so far.

"It's a good way to hang out with people you don't see every day," Hughes said. "It definitely helps you make new friends."

For Brandon Jose, volleyball was his first experience with intramurals, and he had a lot of fun recognizing that he hung out with people other than his close friends.

"It gives you something to do if you live in the dorms," said Jose.

For those who enjoy the thrill of competition, like Kay Pallack, sand volleyball is just the ticket. Pallack likes the competiveness and how the heat of the moment brings out her wild side.

Whether those who showed up come out to play for fun, exercise, or competition, there was no better way to end a day of strenuous academics than to feel the sand between their toes, the thump of the ball as they made contact, and the cheer of their team as points were scored.

On behalf of the Arizona Intramural Program, Jennifer Tagaban invites everyone to, "Come out and join in the action."
