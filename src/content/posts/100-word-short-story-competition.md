100-Word Short Story Competition

Is brevity really the soul of wit? Here's a chance to find out. Submit your very best short story composed of 100 words or less. That's right, 100 words! Your challenge is to distill a story down to its essence, without sacrificing its narrative impact.

Eligibility: The contest is open to all current AWC, U of A-Yuma, and NAU-Yuma students, faculty and staff.

Deadline: Thursday February 19th 2015 (by 5 p.m.)

Winning Submissions:

Two first-place winners (one from both the Student and Faculty/Staff categories) will receive a prize of $50.00 and publication in AWC's student newspaper, Western Voice.

Two second-place selections will receive gift packages and publication in Western Voice.

Honorable mention stories may also be selected and will appear in Western Voice.

Submission Guidelines:

Story submissions must total no more than 100 words , not including the author's name and the story's title.

Stories must be original, unpublished works of fiction.

Each author is limited to two submissions.

Hardcopy submissions can be turned in at the front desk of the Humanities Office (LR-068) or through email at creativewriting@azwestern.edu. Attach your submission as a word file. Manuscripts will not be returned. Authors should keep a copy for themselves.

Entries must be written primarily in English, although brief passages in another language are acceptable.

Format:

Stories must be typed and double-spaced in 12-point Times New Roman font.

Manuscripts must include the following:

1. The writer's name, email, and telephone number.

2. The writer's designation (student or faculty/staff)

3. An original title.

Judging: Submissions will be considered blindly, with the author's name removed. The judges for the 2015 competition are AWC English Professors Eric Lee, Terri Brown, and Clayton Nichols.
