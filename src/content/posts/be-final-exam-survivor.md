How do you last in your classes all the way to the end of the semester?

Arizona Western College nurse Allison Steinly was in the LR building on January 22 to present information for students on how to survive the semester and ace those finals. Steinly, who works for AWC's Health Services, is also the campus health educator.

Steinly's presentation made the following suggestions on how to start the semester off right and get ahead early in order to end the semester with great grades:

Don't get behind on assignments

Immerse yourself in studies

Establishing a study routine

Study without distractions

Don't wait until the last minute to study for tests

Make sure to understand what tests are going to cover before starting to study

Develop good test-taking techniques

Get plenty of sleep

Health Services is located in Cottage #1 and is open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The nurse's direct line is (928) 317-6121, and the office phone number is (928) 344-7602.
