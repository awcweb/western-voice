And the winner is...

The AWC Foundation is pleased to announce that Professor Emeritus David Godley is the Arizona Western College Distinguished Alumni Award for 2013. This is a very prestigious award and was presented at the Homecoming football game to help celebrate the 50th Anniversary of AWC.

Prof. Godley first arrived at AWC as a freshman in 1970. He transferred to NAU and received his B.S. in Accountancy in 1974.

He returned to AWC in the early 1980s as an adjunct faculty member and became a full-time Professor of Accounting is 1986. In the early 1990s he became a part-time instructor for NAU.

In 2007, he received his Master of Administration with distinction from NAU with an emphasis in Educational Leadership.

Godley has served AWC in many capacities, including Freshman Class President in 1970, Division of Business Chairman, Chairman of the Curriculum Committee and the initial President of the AWC Faculty Association. He serves currently as the first President of the AWC Alumni Association.

He has also served two terms as a City Councilman and Deputy Mayor for the City of Yuma.

"AWC [and NAU] have been a main focus in my life for 43 years," said Godley, adding, "I plan to continue my work at both AWC and NAU for years to come."

Godley says that right now making the AWC Alumni Association the best it can be is a high priority, with the Foundation staff leading the way.

"There's a saying that your worst day on the golf course is better than your best day at work," says Godley. "I have been blessed, and my golf-work analogy is interchangeable."
