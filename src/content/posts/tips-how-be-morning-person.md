Would you consider yourself an early bird or a night owl? The majority of us would probably say night owl. We all know how much of a struggle it is to get out of bed in the morning, especially if we’re getting up to go to school.

Each of us has had that morning battle with ourselves, you know the one where you’re laying comfortably in bed, in-between the sheets, nice and warm, and you have the following conversation with yourself: “Do I really have to get up for school? Why can’t it be Saturday? Just five more minutes…”

Then you proceed and hit snooze, but those 5 minutes turn into 25, and so now you’re rushing yourself. You end up eating a small breakfast, you wear a hat because you decided it’s a bad hair day, and you just put on the first set of clothes you can find and rush off.

With the following tips, you will no longer dread mornings as much, and you just might be able to call yourself an early bird:

Plan your morning routine: The night before, write down in an agenda all the things to do in the morning and everything you’ll need for the day. Or simply make a list and tape it to your mirror, door or light switch. Also, if you schedule your most important plans in the morning, you’ll be excited to do them when you wake up. Have your outfit ready and hung in your closet all together; that way dressing is easy breezy in the morning. Pack your lunch so you can just grab-n-go in the morning.

Set an alarm: Rushing is never good, so set your alarm to an hour and a half before the time that you have to leave your house. Put your alarm across the room; that way you actually have to get up to it turn off instead of pressing snooze a million times. That way you’re already up and out of bed and you’ll say, “Well, might as well just start getting ready for the day.”

Don’t eat late: Don’t eat too much before you go to bed. It’s recommended to not eat at least two hours before you go to sleep since it hard to sleep with food in your stomach. You feel full and end up tossing and turning in bed and losing sleep.

Get enough sleep: It’s recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Therefore, shut off your phone so you’re not lying in bed seeing what’s on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, losing sleep and ultimately productivity time in the morning.

Relax and take your time: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Have a delicious breakfast that’ll fill you up for the morning. It makes your morning exciting looking forward to something such as waffles, eggs, fruit, and some toast on the side instead of a plain cereal. Read the newspaper or your newsfeed; simply enjoy your morning.

Leave your house on time: You had a nice and relaxing morning; now it is time to head off and do your planned activities for the day. Getting up early and having time for everything in the morning translates to the start of a good day.
