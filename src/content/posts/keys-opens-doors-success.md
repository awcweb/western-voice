Tough economic times have given way to an increasingly challenging job market. Students need every advantage they can get, and at Arizona Western College they get the "keys."

KEYS is a program that offers services for students who need tutoring with their college classes, or for those who have low income. As participants in the KEYS program, students have at their fingertips a variety of services that have been tailored just for them. They also have a team of highly skilled and dedicated professionals working with them who are concerned about their future success.

This international program, which began with the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, offers new student services each year. It is open to any student with the appropriate requirements of gender, ethnicity, economic status, educational background or disabilities.

Participating in the program increases students' chances of success here and in all future educational endeavors. The program not only has expanded and improved its services, but also has raised the level of its lessons and targeted skills.

"I love the fact they really help you succeed in your career as much as they can," says Angie Gephardt, a student in the program since 2008.

"I learn about tutors and the plan advisors have and to manage time wisely," she adds. "They show they care and follow students until they complete the semester."

This community college helps students transfer to universities and achieve their goals. Students can make appointments with an advisor for help on updating their academic plans and applying for financial aid.

For more information about the KEYS program, contact any of the program advisors at (928)344-7761, or visit their Website: www.azwestern.edu/sss. Hours of operation are Monday-Thursday from 7:00 a.m. -- 5:00 p.m.
