April is recognized nationally as National Poetry Month. The Creative Writing School of Arizona Western College is celebrating by kicking off the month by hosting Poetry at High Noon, a poetry reading to be held on the main campus, Wednesday, April 6, 2011 in the AC (Academic Complex) room 286 from 12:15-1:30pm. This event will feature readings from two former AWC professors; David Coy and Porchia Moore.

The first National Poetry Month was held in 1996 by The Academy of American Poets; a group of publishers, booksellers, librarians, literary organizations, poets, and teachers. Poetry is loved by many as the deepest form of expression in many varieties and styles. Whether found in the perfect greeting card verse, a collection of poetry books , or listening to poetic lyrics in your favorite songs, poetry is loved by everyone.

David Lavar Coy is a retired professor from Arizona Western College where he directed the Writing School for eighteen years and edited Colorado Crossing, the student literary magazine. He holds a B. A. from the University of Wyoming and an M. F. A. from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He is the author of two books of poems: Rural News and Lean Creatures. He is the recipient of numerous honors, including two AWP Intro Awards. He has been a visiting writer to San Diego State University, and a performer in a number of other venues, including the Poetas de la Migracion in Yuma, Arizona and San Luis, Mexico. He is currently collaborating on a book of poems with David Tammer entitled, Down Time to Tombstone. His poetry is influenced by his rural experiences in Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri and Arizona.
