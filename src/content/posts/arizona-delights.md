Ever wonder what delicious wonders await in the Yuma Valley? Sitting at 1583 S Avenue B is one of the best donut shops I have ever been to, Arizona Donuts. As someone who loves food a bit too much, I have been to a number of donut shops throughout my life, and this one may be the king.

As I walked in, I was greeted by an astonishing array of baked goods ranging from dozens of different types of donuts, cookies and cakes all the way to the giant selection of burgers, burritos and fries. It was a true delight to the senses. The variety that the store has to offer is truly amazing, and all at reasonable prices.

I finally settled on the carne asada fries, although I could've landed on their huge selection of burgers, fries, or burritos, which are filled with great meats, vegetables and cheeses to satisfy any appetite. The interior of Arizona Donuts is on the plain side, but this is a place more for quick, quality food rather than for ambiance.

I sat down in one of the booths. I was looking forward to what I was about to receive when my name was called, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I greeted at my table a giant serving of fries, melted cheese and tender beef. The smell was just as good as the taste, a great aroma of three ingredients that blend together so well.

After I had finished, of course, I had to indulge in a donut or two. I landed on a traditional glazed donut and a Boston Cream. Both were everything I expected, so fresh and moist, not to mention that their sheer size was incredible. My friends and I were more than happy with our visit to Arizona Donuts. The great prices and the fact that they're open 24/7 made the visit all the better.

On another occasion I made a visit purely to indulge in donuts. This time, I ordered a variety of donuts, all while being served kindly and respectfully by the cashier. The Boston Cream, traditional glazed and strawberry-filled were all absolutely delicious and had that great classic donut smell and taste.

I would definitely recommend Arizona Donuts. Whether it's for dinner or just a donut, it is one of the great things you can experience in Yuma.
