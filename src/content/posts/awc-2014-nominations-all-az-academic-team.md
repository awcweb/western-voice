2 AWC students nominated for All AZ Academic Team

Arizona Western College students Barbara Asenjo (center right) and Sarah Brewer (center left), this year's nominees for the Arizona Community College Academic Team, are pictured with Director of Honors Liz Renaud and AWC President Dr. Glenn Mayle. Brewer will receive a $1,000 scholarship for earning a spot on the First Team ALL AZ Academic team; and Barbara will receive a $750 scholarship for Second Team placement. This entitles the students to each receive a presidential scholarship to the in-state university of their choice which will be awarded on Feb. 19 at a statewide recognition in Tempe. Congratulations to our Academic achievers!
