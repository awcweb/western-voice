Americans are known for their gracious giving all over the world from earthmoving equipment to medicines. The United States is known for always acting on their best instinct. Our military is always a great resource for bringing order and leadership to places in chaos. The catastrophe taking place after a powerful earthquake hit Haiti is just one example of the services our military offers the world. Haiti is a reminder of the power of earthquakes for those of us living here in the Yuma area who would like to help.

Since the January 12 incident in Haiti, Yuma has taken a big role in helping the victims. Robert Vigil, investigator for the Yuma County medical examiner's office was deployed to Haiti to help with the earthquake's aftermath in Port-Au-Prince. His duties include helping identify and return the remains of U.S. citizens to their families. Dr. Todd Runyan, an orthopedic surgeon, flew to Haiti at his own expense. Before returning home, he is scheduled to perform 100 surgeries, primarily on children, in three days. Runyan is going with some friends from Doctors Without Borders, an international medical humanitarian organization who provides aid to countries around the world in desperate need of medical care.

With volunteers ranging from doctors to teenagers, Haiti will have more than enough help. Nineteen-year-old Yuma resident Jack Carson got a text message asking if he would like to go and help out in Haiti. The text came from a friend who visited the country right after the 7.0 magnitude catastrophic earthquake in January. Now, a couple of weeks later, Carson will fly out of Yuma, connect in Florida, and meet up with a group of friends in Haiti who will work with St. Mary's Mission in the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince.

The Vertical Church in Yuma didn't waste any time to see what they can do. One week after the earthquake, the church arranged for gathering all of its offerings from Sunday's service and donated it directly to help those in Haiti. According to the church's website, the money will be spent through partnerships established with neighboring Dominican Republic and through the Dominican Baptist Convention.

Yuma music educators, moved by the horrific images they saw of the earthquake, decided to use their talents to help relieve the devastation. The Haitian Play-A-Thon, a variety of Yuma school bands, has showcased 15 Yuma school musical ensembles in front of the Harkins Theatres. The idea came from Maggie Fenske, Yuma Lutheran School orchestra teacher, and is being coordinated through Patricia Moore, Crane Middle School band director and secretary of Yuma County Education Association.

The bands are teaming up with the Salvation Army, who will be out there with collection buckets. Although the concert is free, Salvation Army requests anyone who is able to make a donation. There are still a lot of people in Haiti without basic necessities, and Salvation Army has a lot of work they want to complete over there. It's also a good opportunity to make everyone aware of the great musical programs at our schools. Another music performer, who is also helping,, is Ed Taylor, a Yuma native and well-known jazz musician. He will donate 15% of the proceeds from ticket sales to disaster relief funds, including aid for Haiti.

Not only has Yuma helped, but people all around the country are contributing to Haiti. The American Red Cross pledged $10 million to help Haiti. President Barrack Obama has pledged an initial $100 million, with the likelihood of more to come, along with 5,500 troops already on their way. The American people are known for their gracious giving all over the world. The horrific disaster in Haiti will be met by the incomparable response of the United States. Our hearts go out to the people of Haiti. While many countries will make valuable, life-saving contributions, America will come with the most and the best and likely stay the longest.
