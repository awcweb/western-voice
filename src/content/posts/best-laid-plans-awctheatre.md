Here's your chance to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the College and experience great literature at the same time.

This month, AWCTheatre will present John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" at the AWC Theater on campus. The play will include eight performances -- Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 15, 16 & 17, and Wednesday through Sunday, Nov. 20 through 24. The two Sunday performances begin at 2:30 p.m., and all other performances begin at 7:30 p.m.

Arizona Western College is celebrating its 50th Anniversary, and this production is a part of that celebration. In the late 1960s, "Of Mice and Men" was performed here at the College, and AWCTheatre has chosen to tell this tale again since the story resonates with all Americans (well, the ones with a heart at any rate) and is a part of our national literary and theatrical heritage.

AWCTheatre does not charge admission but does ask for a donation of either ten dollars, five items of non-perishable food or five articles of clean, wearable clothing. AWCTheatre will in turn re-donate the food to the Yuma Community Food Bank and the clothing to the Crossroads Mission, two organizations that are alone in doing what they do for the greater Yuma community.

In this way, AWCTheatre teaches its students that the theatre is part of the community and that we too must do our part to make sure that everyone has access to the necessities of life.

As always, AWCTheatre thanks you for your continued support of the arts in Yuma.
