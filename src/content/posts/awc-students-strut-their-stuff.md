The long hallway on the south end of the 3C building was bustling with people, and displays of every sort lined the walls for the Golden Student Showcase on April 30.

Sunlight streamed in through the floor-to-ceiling windows and shone brightly on dozens of posters, each representing a single student's hard work on a project.

Braulio Alvarado, a General Studies major at AWC, proudly displayed his poster explaining the life-cycle and delivering fun facts about the Blue Yucca.

Rio Jauregui, a Studio Art major, talked with passers-by about her painting, which was still a work in progress, Rio explained the parts of the painting she was still perfecting.

Adolfo Anaya, a Welding Tech major, had a table displaying some of the intricate welding art he has created. He discussed the trial and error process he went through to create long-stemmed roses made out of metal.

AWC President, Dr. Glenn Mayle, was among the crowd perusing the art and enjoying the performance given by the AWC Chamber Singers. The AWC Youth Choir, comprised of six talented young girls, also gave a crowd-pleasing performance.

The AWC Karate Club also gave a demonstration of different forms and stances, and students of the Southwest Writer's Alliance of AWC gave poetry readings.

While the college-wide focus for the year was on Scientific Literacy, presentations were encouraged from all disciplines, genres and topics -- poster and oral presentations, poetry readings, performing arts, digital media, photography and so on.

A great opportunity for students to display their talent, the Golden Student Showcase was an even better opportunity for the other students and faculty to see the hard work and dedication that goes on behind the scenes.
