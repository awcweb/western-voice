Check this blogspot weekly (or weakly) for the random musings of the mad movie critic - me, Dane Jacobson. My initial foray into the the world of the cyber-critique is a brief list of my top faves, filmwise. Feel free to comment:

1. Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep)

2. Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic)

3. David Lynch (Inland Empire, Eraserhead)

4. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie, Delicatessen)

5. Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood)
