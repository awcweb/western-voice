Local business leaders contributed their time and knowledge to help future leaders develop their business acumen at the annual Economics Forum held at Arizona Western College.

More than 100 economic students attended this year's annual Economics Forum that took place on November 6 in the Schoening Conference Center. Students were able apply their own knowledge and discuss the economic situation of this nation as well as other things with a panel of key decision makers from the city of Yuma.

The panel was made up of 10 distinguished business and economic experts. This included; Terry Frydenlund, President and CEO of 1st Bank Yuma, Bill Gresser, Owner of Papa- San Rice Bowl, Dr. Stephen Cummings, doctor or Cummings Chiropractic Office, Julie Engel, President of Greater Yuma Economic Development Program, etc.

"It's an honor to be part of this event because it's wonderful to see students get connected with the real world", says Professor of Economics, Michelle Sims. Professor Sims has been one of the organizers since the event first started back in the fall of 2009.

Every year, this forum has been fortunate to be able to include such a diverse panel of presidents, CEOs, Vice-presidents, directors, etc. " This event is great, students come in off-time to learn about new things and anything they can get from this is a good thing," says Dr. Cummings from Cummings Chiropractic Office.

Students were able to participate by asking the panelist a variety of questions and getting an input of real life economic situations through the eyes of experienced business and economic experts; from discussing about the housing market to business do's and don't to the Affordable Health Care Act.

Even though many students that attended were in search of a few extra credit points, many of them received a lot more than they had expected. "It provided me with a wider outlook on current issues that concern us as a society in order to better prepare us for the future as productive members of our community", says economics student, Hiram Aguilar.

It was a positive insight that many students were able to receive from the experienced panelists. This was such a beneficial event for students that will be the future business and economic leaders of this nation.
