Dear Campus,

Congratulations again to Stephen Moore, Professor of English, this year's Arizona Western College Teacher of the Year. This distinction includes a scholarship opportunity for an outstanding high school student residing within the College district who intends to attend AWC next year, or to a continuing AWC student.

Prof. Moore has chosen a continuing student to receive his scholarship award. Angela Donelson is a second-semester nursing student who will receive three semesters of tuition and fees. Moore and his student scholarship recipient were recognized at the Teacher of the Year Banquet on April 21.

A Kofa High School graduate, Donelson said she was overwhelmed and humbled to be chosen to receive the Stephen Moore Presidential Teacher of the Year Scholarship award. Congratulations, again, to both professor and student.

--President Mayle
