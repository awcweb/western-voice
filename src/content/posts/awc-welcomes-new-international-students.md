For as little as $2.50 with a student ID, or $5 without one, you can watch award-winning independent films at Thursday at the Theatre, sponsored by the AWC Foundation, in Yuma's Historic Art Theatre on Main Street.

The evening event begins at 7 p.m. The doors open at 6:30 pm so that film viewers will have time to purchase $2 bags of popcorn, $2 sodas and find a good seat. Before the feature film, AWC Professor Michael Miller gives an introduction and any disclaimers, and an award-winning short film is shown.

After both films, interested viewers are welcome to stay and join Professor Miller's film class to discuss and critique the films.

The following are the Fall 2013 films along with a synopsis of each:

October 2, 2014 -- 2 Autumns, 3 Winters (France | 2013 | Comedy/Romance | French w/ English subtitles | 193 minutes)

"A quirky French indie...filled with oodles of visual flourishes." -- Jordan Mintzer, The Hollywood Reporter

Synopsis Arman is 33 and ready to make a change, starting with a run in the park. When he literally bumps into AmÈlie - slightly cynical but nevertheless lovely - on the jogging path, he's dead-set on making a connection with her. As a bit of contrived fate brings them together, Arman's best friend Benjamin suffers an unexpected stroke, relegating him to the hospital for weeks where he falls for his doting young physical therapist. Over the course of two autumns and three winters, Arman, AmÈlie and Benjamin share the incidental moments, unexpected accidents, unconventional love stories and unforgettable memories that will define who they are.

November 6, 2014 -- Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? (Taiwan | 2013 | Comedy | Mandarin w/ English subtitles | 106 minutes)

"Wry and whimsical!" -- Jordan Mintzer, The Hollywood Reporter

Synopsis: In this madcap and lighthearted comedic romp, introverted optometrist Weichung begins to question his marriage with his wife Feng, upon learning of her desire to have another baby. At his sister's engagement party, Weichung bumps into an old friend, Stephen, a wedding photographer who, though also married, is living the high life of a younger, single gay man. When Stephen teases Weichung for his newly straightlaced lifestyle, dormant emotions are awakened in Weichung, setting him off on a quest for true romance and desire.

December 4, 2014 -- The Auction (France | 2013 | Drama | French w/ English subtitles | 112 minutes)

"An elegantly simple family farming drama [that is]...beautifully shot and impressively performed!" -- Mark Adams, Screen Daily

Synopsis: A man of few words, Gaby manages his family's farm - Buchard & Sons - on his own, despite his advancing age. With no actual sons to speak of and his two grown daughters living far away in the big city, he spends his days tending to the animals and land that surround him, eschewing modern technology and most social interactions. When his eldest daughter, Marie, appears at the family homestead to share news that she's finally getting divorced and in desperate need of money in order to keep the home where she and her children live, Gaby's quiet life begins to unravel. In an effort to tend to his children much the way he steadfastly tends to his farm, he'll be forced to make sacrifices he never intended for the sake of those closest to him.
