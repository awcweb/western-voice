Do you ever get the feeling that everything is coming down on you all at once? Like the world suddenly decided to make you the target? Midterms are creeping around the corner, and Finals will be here before you know it, so it's important to stay on top of things and make sure you're keeping a good attitude.

To that end, Arizona Western College's Continuing Education Program has some ideal tips for getting through the semester.

Throughout September, Continuing Ed has partnered with the Yuma Regional Cancer Center in providing the Vitality Series, which focuses on giving great tips to people in the Yuma community on how to maintain healthier lives. The program offers classes from "Aromatherapy for Nausea and Fatigue" to "Gentle Yoga" to "Meditation to Strategies for Better Sleep."

Meditation, for example, is a topic that a lot of people think of as taboo. Many are quick to assume that it is a sacred and religious experience, but it doesn't have to be.

Meditation is a way to get in tune with oneself and take a break from the constant fast pace of the world.

"It's so simple and yet so powerful," says the meditation instructor, Darin Fenger.

"You're more confident and more alert."

The first tip that Fenger offers is to meditate for at least 5-10 minutes a day, or whatever is most comfortable. It is important to take good care of ourselves both physically and mentally, says Fenger, by simply taking a break.

The second tip is to surround oneself with positive people who support and lift us up. Being surrounded by people who are constantly encouraging bad behavior makes it much easier to develop stress.

The third tip is to remember to have fun and do enjoyable things like painting, exercising or hiking.

And, last but not least, it's critical to get a good night's rest.

Students have a lot of homework, exams and extracurricular activities on their plates, and they often forget to take time for themselves. Without a doubt, following some of these tips will start to bring about positive changes in no time.
