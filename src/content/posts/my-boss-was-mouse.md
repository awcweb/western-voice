"You don't have to work a day if you love what you do" is a well-known phrase. But do you really believe it?

The best way to know if a job is right for you is to actually try it. There are internships in almost every line of work to prepare you for the future. So why not try one with the only Fortune 100 company that offers one thing -- entertainment?

The Walt Disney Company offers an amazing internship in all parts of the world, including Florida and California, called the Disney College Program. Fortunately, I was one of the few students accepted into the program at the Disneyland Resort in the fall of 2011.

A backstage pass

Ever since I was a child, I had always been obsessed with the princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid. My passion for Disney movies, songs and especially memorabilia grew stronger every year.

I was never able to visit the actual parks as a kid because my family lived in North Carolina and could never spare such a shiny penny. It wasn't until my freshman year at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., that I heard about an internship opportunity at the happiest place on earth. I instantly applied for the program and was accepted. I packed my bags from North Carolina and made my way to the West Coast, and my life has changed ever since.

We began the six-month program with a welcome celebration into our new apartments, and I met my four other roommates. Although the rooms were pricy, and five of us shared a two bedroom apartment, there were many great memories in that complex full of college program students (CPs).

After 19 years of waiting and obsessing, not only was I able to visit the park, I practically lived there! Employees get into the park for free, and, even though I had never been there before, I was an expert on all things Disney by the end of the six-month program.

Start with a mouse

The first few days of training are as magical as the park itself. I was placed in the Paradise Pier foods area, moving throughout the different restaurants as a host.

Disney was a place where I could genuinely learn to grow up. I had to pay my own rent and buy my own food, and for the first time I truly understood why people who work 40 hours a week were always so tired.

As CPs, we were able to take classes by Disney executives to learn how to be a professional. I took a class called Marketing You, which was an awesome opportunity to learn the fine details of marketing oneself in the professional world. I got to meet the Vice Presidents of Disneyland and California Adventures as well as the CEO of the Walt Disney Corporation, Bob Iger.

During the program, Disney allowed the interns to take special trips and host exclusive events that we were able to take advantage of. I was able to ride Space Mountain with the lights on. They took the CPs on tours of different attractions to show how everything works offstage. Also, I was able to see the restaurant and kitchen of the exclusive Club 33.

Walt Disney used to say that the company "started with a mouse," and this amazing internship can start with one, too. Use your mouse to go online and apply for this internship, and you'll never be sorry.

Dream it. Do it. Disney.
