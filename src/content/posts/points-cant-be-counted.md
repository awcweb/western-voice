This season for the AWC men's soccer team began with soaring expectations. After the monumental win over Phoenix College last year in the All Star game, the team had their hearts set on a repeat.

However, what Division Coach of the Year Kenny Dale wants to impress upon his team is that being the best team does not mean winning the most games, and in no way is it their top priority.

"The most important aspect for a team is progress," says Dale. "The bettering of the athletes is always number one."

With seven returning sophomores, the team has many incredible players leading their teammates by example. And being able to show the first-year AWC players how to work as a team and why it is important to make camaraderie a priority has taken the team through an outstanding season.

"We had a lot of fresh feet on the field this season, which really helps our team see how much potential is truly here," said Oscar Hernandez .

Interaction between every member of the team is what glues these 22 players into a unit. At every AWC soccer game, the audience can hear the team members communicating with each other and helping each other.

"We have a great team because we have so much trust set in one another," midfielder Erik Luzanilla confidently states after a win against Yavapai College. "The keys to a successful soccer team are communication and trust, and we have both."

The 2012 season for Men's Soccer was one for the history books. Winning all their home games and making their way to the Semifinals showed the strength of the soccer program at AWC.

With a 19-4 record, they have completed the season outstandingly, not because of the number of games they won or didn't win but because of the leaps and bounds they progressed as a team, and because of the effort and trust they put forth, using their diversities as an advantage and always keeping the team close.

These are the points the AWC Men's soccer team has scored that just can't be counted.
