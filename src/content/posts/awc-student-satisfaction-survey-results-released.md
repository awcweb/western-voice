In September 2010, 1500 students were surveyed to distinguish the student satisfaction levels in eight areas of campus life: Academic Advising, Admissions and Financial Aid, Campus Climate, Campus Services, Instructional Effectiveness, Registration Effectiveness, Safety and Security, and Student Centeredness.

AWC faculty administered the surveys during class time to randomly selected classes throughout Parker, Quartzsite, Wellton, Entrepreneurial Center, Somerton, San Luis and the Main Campus, yet there was still just a 61% response rate.

Those students who responded answered questions about their interest and satisfaction levels on 50 items. The Noel-Levitz research company provided the standard research tool that was used. This tool allows for faculty and staff to evaluate “gaps” between the two levels and chart changes strategically. It also measures AWC against schools nationally and regionally.

AWC students measured the institution slightly below the national average and slightly above the regional average. Areas of highest satisfaction levels were:

Printed schedule of classes provided with date/time/location.

Campus is well-maintained.

Computer labs are adequate and accessible.

The campus is safe and secure for all students.

The quality of instruction I receive in most of my classes is excellent.

The campus provides online access to services I need.

Students are made to feel welcome.

The students expressed the most dissatisfaction with:

The amount of parking space on campus is inadequate.

No readily available channels for expressing student complaints

They can’t easily get involved in campus organizations.

Personnel in the Veterans’ Services program are unhelpful.

They don’t receive ongoing feedback about progress toward academic goals

Their academic advisor is unknowledgeable about transfer requirements of other schools.

Although the channels for complaints, involvement in campus organizations and personnel in the Veterans Services lacked student satisfaction, they were also on the lowest interest list as well. Parking and Academic Advisement satisfaction seems to be the main concerns for needed improvement for AWC students.

The results of this survey are shared around the campus to set departmental and institutional goals to address these satisfaction issues. The survey will be distributed again every two years to measure improvements. Next year, AWC will also engage in two other surveys related to learning levels of Community College Student Engagement and the Faculty survey of Student Engagement.
