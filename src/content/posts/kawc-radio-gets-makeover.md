Just in case you were unaware, Arizona Western College has its own local radio network – KAWC – that airs on both AM and FM channels.

The network has recently received a facelift with the help of a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and a little local research. The Engaging Communities on the Economy grant has enabled KAWC to re-launch itself under the banner of Colorado River Public Media, allowing it to reach the Mohave and La Paz counties. But that is not all that has changed.

Prior to August 14, 2009, the station aired identical programming on both AM and FM channels. But starting now, news and discussion programming will be aired only on 88.9 FM while the AM 1320 station will feature all music all the time.

KAWC’s 88.9 FM is appropriately named “Real News When You Need It.” It includes news programming from National Public Radio (NPR) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) airing Monday through Friday between 4 a.m. and 8p.m. The station also will air “Arizona Edition” daily – at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. – a program that focuses on regional news and information.

The redesigned station is not completely unrecognizable though. KAWC-FM will continue to air classical music in the evenings and jazz on the weekends. Additionally, listeners will still be able to tune in to program favorites such as “Car Talk” and “A Prairie Home Companion.”

For music lovers, KAWC presents “Community Radio and A World of Music,” on the AM 1320 band. The schedule includes an all-day music program called “The Bridge.” It focuses on Americana, blues and world music Monday through Friday with classical music and opera on the weekends.

To put an emphasis on the term “community radio,” KAWC is encouraging local citizens and students alike to get involved. Listeners can send in playlists of songs they would like to hear and can even sign up to receive free training to become volunteer DJs.

The station also is open to hosting local bands to play live sets on the air. KAWC has aired four bands so far from a variety of genres – local rock band Loaner, Jeremy Gillman (aka GERM), the hip-hop group Cerebral Arts and performers from the Yuma Jazz Company.

Now you may be asking, “Why news on FM and music on AM? Shouldn’t it be the other way around?” Not necessarily. Last spring KAWC did some strategic planning and found that news and information programming was the most valuable service the network provides. It was this information that led the network in their decision to air news and music separately.

FM channels have a stronger signal, so it made sense to KAWC Station Manager Dave Riek and his staff to air the news services on the stronger station. Wanting to be efficient with their AM airtime and preferring not to repeat the FM programming, the staff of KAWC decided to utilize the AM station for community radio.

But KAWC reception is not limited to car stereos. Fans can follow the station on Twitter and Facebook as well. KAWC is also looking into setting up a MySpace account to further reach Yuma’s music community. There is a KAWC website, too, where listeners can find online resources, social media, information about the station and the full AM and FM schedules. At KAWC.org fans can also listen to the station online – a very popular feature boasting tens of thousands of internet air time every month. According to Riek, the local program “Gaboury’s Private Stock” has fans listening in from as far away as Hawaii.

When asked how the community has reacted to the new changes, Riek stated, “The overall reaction has been overwhelmingly positive.” Riek has high hopes for the future of Yuma’s own local radio network.
