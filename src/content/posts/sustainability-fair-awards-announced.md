Please join the Sustainability Council in congratulating our 2013 Sustainability Fair Award Winners: CDLL staff member, Jane Parker: Science Club President Teresa Reyes and AWC Director of District Operations Steve Eckert. Here's what their nominators had to say about them:

Jane Parker (CDLL Staff member), "Jane teaches the children in her preschool to reduce the waste that they make by turning off faucets, and mining their paper towel usage. She teaches children to reuse old items by making toys out of soda bottles and other discarded items, as well as running a composting project. "

Teresa Reyes (Recycling Coordinator), "Last fall Teresa began representing the Science Club at Sustainability Council meetings and coordinating with the Student Government to expand the recycling program and assure its continuity after she graduates."

Steve Eckert (Director of District Operations), "Steve has implemented and spearheaded many projects to help make AWC a more Earth friendly environment and his unwavering hard work and dedication to sustainability has made him a worthy recipient for the Sustainability Fair Award."

About the Awards

Title: Campesino or Man of the Earth cultivating Pacha Mama Sculpture design and built by: AWC Professor of Welding Samuel Colton, AWC Welding Majors John Stratz and Adrain Castillo.

Made from repurposed and recycled materials, the Campesino is cultivating the "Pacha Mamma" or Earth Mother. The repurposed bolts that the Campesino is made from represents the strength of the agriculture worker everywhere and the respect for our planet and is made from steel materials in acknowledgement of the fact that modern agriculture practices rely heavily on metals and welding to build the irrigation systems, tractors and other mechanical items that makes productive, profitable and sustainable agriculture possible.

The Campesino represents the human aspect of agriculture and stands to remind us that growing food is important to us all. The aluminized paint was destined to be thrown away due to being out of date but found its way to our sculpture to preserve the metallic surface and bring brilliance to it. The idea that the Earth has given up its metals for the benefit of mankind to build tools for agriculture and to feed the world.
