Do you have a passion for the fine arts? Want to be a part of a group where you can discuss that passion and share the joy? If so, the English Honor Society will be perfect for you.

Open to majors and non-majors alike, this is a brand-new student club here at Arizona Western College. It is a national organization for students and staff at two-year colleges who love and appreciate literature. It promotes leadership, interactions among people interested in the fine arts, engagement in various academic activities and, yes, plain old fun.

The club will have leadership opportunities such as President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasure.

"There are at least 3 or 4 positions for student leadership to engage with the larger community on behalf of the English Honors Society," says English professor and club advisor Dr. Eric Lee.

Some of the many benefits to joining the society are scholarship money, lifetime membership, opportunities for publication, development of leadership skills and life experience.

Prospective members must be enrolled in a two-year college, they must have completed at least one English or literature course with a B or better and they must have a 3.0 overall GPA or better.

AWC is currently the only community college in Arizona that has an active chapter of the English Honors Society.

In the future, the Society hopes to increase the number of visiting writers at AWC, plan different events such as literature-themed parties, hold fundraisers and get more students excited about and involved in the fine arts.

"The future is unlimited!" says Dr. Lee.
