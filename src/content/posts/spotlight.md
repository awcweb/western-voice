While watching television, the thought “I can do a better job than that!” comes to many people’s minds. Maybe it’s the actors who need improvement, maybe the videography. Well, now those critics can put their money where their mouth is.

Arizona Western College’s television production instructor and KAWC station director Sherry Needham and her crew teach all the behind-the-scenes aspects of creating, performing and even airing shows. They also demonstrate how difficult yet fun TV production can be.

Many people work on even the simplest shows, as indicated by how many names and jobs are in the credits, and each one has an important role.

KAWC offers to students an opportunity to be in the limelight. For example, every Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. the showSpotlightairs live on cable Channel 74, with replay times every day of the week at 4:30 and 9:30. The show covers school-related topics to keep the AWC community informed on upcoming events, career opportunities, sports games and more.

Needham offers students the chance not only to observe but also to participate in the live production. This opportunity enlightens those who have little to no experience with such skills as acting, producing, directing, lighting, camera operating, sound mixing.

AWC is one of the greatest places around to get a jump-start on a career or just to try something new. Many news anchors from KYMA or KSWT get their start here, and several of them have been fortunate to advance to stations in Las Vegas or LA.

Needham welcomes anyone to drop in and see what it’s all about, and encourages those who are interested in Television Production 1 or 2 or who have had any experience in the field to stop by BA 117 on Wednesdays at 4 p.m.
