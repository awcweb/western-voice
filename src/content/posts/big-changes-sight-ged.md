Some big changes are on the horizon for the GED test -- good news in some ways, in other ways not so much.

Currently, Arizona Western College is the only proctoring site in Yuma County that administers the General Educational Development (GED) test to the local community. That's handy for prospective college students, because the GED is a lot more important these days than it used to be. For one thing, applicants for financial aid now need either a high-school diploma (which includes passing the controversial AIMS test) or the GED.

AWC also is one of five sites in Arizona piloting the new GED computer-testing procedure, which at the end of the current semester will replace the 2002 paper-and-pencil version. For a short time, applicants for the test will have their choice.

Pros & cons

Each of the two versions has its pros and cons. Some applicants may not be entirely comfortable with computer-based testing, and for them registering now for the paper-pencil GED is a good idea. The paper-pencil version is also less expensive than computer testing at only $105 for all five tests. Computer testing is $30 per test, for a total of $150 for all five tests.

In contrast, applicants who choose computer testing have more chances for retesting because the process of grading each test is immediate. Also, it is administered in both Spanish and English, so the language barrier has been removed. The proctors at the testing center are bilingual as well, so communication will not be an issue.

A brief window

The last day to register for the paper-pencil version is Nov. 19, and the last testing session for that version is Dec. 19. Candidates must come in person to the AWC Testing Center, where they will register by bringing in two government identifications and filling out some demographic information. In taking the test, they will choose between the 2002 paper-pencil version and the computer version via Pearson Vue.

Of course, those who rush to take the older version should not have false hopes of passing it instantly. Applicants should study hard beforehand and concentrate while testing because, in the event of not passing the test, having to start all over with the new version would be a waste of money.

On the other hand, some people have already started the GED and need to complete it in order to avoid losing the money they already have spent on the tests.

For more information, applicants should visit the proctoring webpage at azwestern.edu/testing, which provides information about the GED tests themselves as well as programs that help with preparation for the certificate.
