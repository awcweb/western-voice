The AWC Art Gallery hosted a reception for the current exhibit on Oct. 1, bringing another bright moment of culture to the campus.

Visitors to the Gallery room (AB 110) were treated to an evening filled with food and some of the best pieces of artwork by art educators from the Yuma area. “We need to bring art to campus to show the artists’ masterpieces,” said Art Professor William N. Blomquist.

One of the highlights of the exhibit was a mixed-media work by Patricia Levy-Andrews entitled “It’s About Time.” According to Levy-Andrews, the piece is about how people want to stop time by taking pictures. Also included was “Little Boy Blue Pants” by Tom Cabrat, which consists of a pair of blue pants on a clothes hangar. Another piece was Albert Escalante’s “Sexy,” a brown sculpture of a woman kneeling down in a provocative pose.

Others included three paintings by Steve Tourdot entitled, “You paint to find out what you’re painting,” “Desert Summer” and “Desert Storm.” Tourdot said the three came from ideas he wrote down and then allowed to take life – a technique he has been using since 1979.

The exhibit displayed through Oct. 12 and offered a wonderful variety of masterpieces. Some of the work of AWC artists will also be shown at another gallery at the University of Arizona in Tucson from Oct. 22–Nov. 10.

Another exhibit will open soon at the AWC Art Gallery. We can only wait with anticipation to see what the gallery will show us next!
