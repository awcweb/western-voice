Maria Fernanda's Art exhibit inside the Art Gallery at Arizona Western College was a sight to behold.

Wood podiums were set up for viewers to leave their comments with prompts such as "I seeÖ" and "I perceiveÖ." Patron left comments like "I see free thoughts yet solid ideas imagination in its raw form still in amazing capture," and "I perceive the essence of beauty, fantasy, death."

Graphic Arts Professor Brad Pease, Fernanda's former teacher, said that since her graduation he has been "really happy to see her progression." He believes that she's not stopping here, though, and that her art is still developing.

What was Fernanda's inspiration behind her collection? Her sister wanted her to do a photo shoot of her and her friends, but when Fernanda looked at the photos, all of the models seemed vulnerable with their faces directed away from the camera.

They seemed more like props than like real people, and for Fernanda that wasn't acceptable. She wanted more from these pictures; she wanted people to look at them and not see someone helpless or dependent but "strong, bright, full of joy and confidence."

To get that effect, though, Fernanda had to get creative. She started with a bold background -- something that would bring contrast to the girls such as worn down buildings. For example, Red Autumn, which features Fernanda's own sister, shows that even in a dirty, messed-up world a woman can still shine and be beautiful.

Each girl is wrapped (while fully clothed) in a long single piece of fabric and is stood on a chair, her hair flying in all directions.

Fernanda talks about how she puts her own touches on her photos after they are taken. She edited out the chair and changed the fabric into whatever she saw in the model's personality, whether that was fire, water, flowers or fields. She took this chance to really show the girls' full potential.

These shots remind Fernanda of the phrase, "My favorite moment to stop and analyze before you jump."

"You put a bunch of crazy people together and you get crazy things," she said.
