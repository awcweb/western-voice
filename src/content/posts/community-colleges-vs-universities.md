Looking at the facts, it is no surprise why students who start in a community college have it cheaper. According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, without factoring in financial aid, the average annual tuition and fees in 2015 was: $3,445 for students attending community colleges, and $9,410 for students attending four year colleges or universities. Arizona Western College, in fact offers a tuition rate that is about 88% lower than that average.

Plus, even with the relatively low rates, nearly a third of community college students receive financial aid. Tutoring services, student activities, and transfer services, are all extras that come free for AWC students.

Lisa Seale, director of financial aid at Arizona Western College, says, "Local students have the advantage of cost savings as a commuter student rather than attending one of the universities in the state. Cost saving are tremendous in tuition alone therefore you can utilize and stretch any of the Federal Student Aid you receive." she adds, "We also offer small class sizes so that you may get to know your professors who care about your learning experience. The community college is a win-win situation."

A smaller class size is a huge advantage in establishing good communication between the students and professors. A much smaller class gives a student greater opportunities to ask questions, participate in a discussion, and have a professor who actually knows who you are.

Community colleges like AWC have a wide variety of professors who focus just on students to prepare themselves to be job-ready as they finish their degree or certificate.

When looking to start college, location comes in second. Moving into a university right after college might not sound like the best life transition. If you have a job in your local area or have daily responsibilities it is much more manageable for you to attend a community college.

High schools should steer students to consider a community college as the "stepping stones" to reaching success. Students should also recognize that community colleges provide higher education, and require prerequisite skills best gained in high school. If given the right support in high school, a community college can be a viable step for some students.

Those who are looking to transfer to a University will see it is a much better choice, rather than jumping into a four year college fresh out of high school. When looking at only the college, the rates of Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees completion increase.

There are many programs to look into, as well as events to attend. It's easy to see that AWC has strong relationships with all three state universities. Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, and University of Arizona are all located in the AWC campus. As for myself, I know I will have a smooth and successful transition when I transfer to ASU in two years. Choosing a community college was indeed an excellent decision.
