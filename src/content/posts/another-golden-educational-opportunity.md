AWC-NAU partnership offers smooth transition to degree in biology

In case you didn't know, AWC and NAU have a seamless transition from a two-year to a four-year degree in Biology, which in turn offers versatility when the graduate joins the work force.

Attaining a degree in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields can produce a technically trained individual who can readily learn and perform technical and challenging job roles. AWC offers a variety of Associate's degrees in STEM fields, but the number of available options for a graduate with a Bachelor's.

Fortunately for those with an interest in the life sciences, Northern Arizona University--Yuma Branch Campus (NAU-Yuma) offers B.S. degrees in biology and environmental science. Students who complete their Bachelor's in our program can take some of the newest and most fascinating science courses that are found at larger universities, such as Molecular Genetics, Sustainable Biology, Environmental Policy and Energy Resources, Biochemistry and Molecular Techniques.

An entry level biologist or environmental scientist can enter the job force to work with government employers like educational institutions, the Bureau of Land Management, Arizona Game and Fish, the Yuma County Health Department or even the FBI. There are also jobs with private-sector employers such as Gowan Chemical, biological laboratories and consultant firms.

A Bachelor's degree in the biological sciences also opens the door to more advanced professions in medicine (physician, pharmacist, dentist), higher education (professor, researcher) and many other fields by way of medical, graduate and other professional schools.

How do students know if a degree in the biological sciences is right for them? If them find science fascinating, if they're curious about the natural world or if they want to be challenged, then this may be it.

Students are expected to develop an advanced body of knowledge, to understand complex systems and to tackle difficult questions. These skills and experiences will be developed in their science courses, undergraduate research projects and internships.

Fortunately students who earn their Associate's in biology or environmental science from AWC transition very smoothly into NAU-Yuma because all the 100- and 200-level courses they completed establish the foundation to their upper-division work.

Don't miss this golden opportunity!
