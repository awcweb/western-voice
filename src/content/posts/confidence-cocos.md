Glamor, style, confidence: Where can you find them in Yuma?

Well, at Coco's, a local clothing store that opened this June targeting the fashionable women of Yuma. It sells not only trendy outfits but also accessories such as eyelash and hair extensions, which can be done by appointment only.

The store gives off a glamorous aura of the ë70s and ë80s, having high-waisted denim jeans and cut-off blouses that accentuate the midriff and bring back the rompers trend. Products fall into the medium-to-upper price range and target younger college-age females, with contemporary styles such as skin tight jeans, see-through tops and bold, colorful dresses.

The store first opened at the Yuma Palms, but the customer population wasn't what the original owners was expected. So they sold the company to the current owners, who then moved to a smaller, more convenient store location in a busy part of town at the intersection of 4th Ave. and 16th St.

Upon entering the store, customers might feel that it's no bigger than a classroom. The employees are friendly with the customers and become their personal assistant by picking out clothes and helping them pick outfits and accessories the customer can rock.

"I love to shop at this store myself, and the customers are so friendly and happy about what Coco has to offer," explains one representative named Bailey.

Bailey expects the holiday season to bring in more clientele as well as notoriety for the store's fashion sense.

Coco's has a Facebook page with many local supporters. Whoever likes Coco's Facebook page has opportunities to get great deals and information about the sales ahead of time.

Happy shopping, ladies!
