In Mexican culture, November 2 is when souls come from where they rest in peace to visit us and to enjoy what they used to do in life. In this traditional Mexican celebration of death, Dia de los Muertos, it is said that the spirits of our departed loved ones come to reencounter the people they love.

Traditionally, the Mexican family goes to where the remains of their dead ones wait with a Zempasuchitl flower (the "flower of death") and the favorite music and food of the deceased. At the cemetery, where Mother Nature disintegrates their remains but not their memories, we recall the anecdotes, adventures and thoughts that will always live in our hearts -- just as our loved ones will remember us.

In a celebration honoring this Hispanic tradition, AWC students and faculty participated in an altar-making competition.

The competition was sponsored by Angel Luna and the AWC Art Program in conjunction with Maria Aguirre, AWC's Diversity Coordinator. This is the third year of the competition, which is designed to inspire an understanding of this very important holiday.

The competition is open to all students and faculty. This year there were five entries. The Karate Club won first place, the Art Club won second and Pam Black won third.

Although every culture has its own unique observances and celebrations, variations on Day of the Dead celebrations are found throughout the world. Aguirre said that she supports this celebration on campus so that "we can have our faculty, staff and students think and rethink how different cultures celebrate the process of passing on."

Luna stated that there was more participation this year and that it is good to see the competition growing. Aguirre added that next year they hope to have a least ten entries in the competition.
