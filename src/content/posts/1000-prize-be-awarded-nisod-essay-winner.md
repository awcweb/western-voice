The National Institute for Staff and Organizational Development (NISOD) announced their fourth annual Community College Week- NISOD Student Essay Contest. The deadline for the essay submission is 9:00 p.m., November 8, 2011 via the online form on NISOD’s website.

The student author must describe a professor, staff member, or administrator who encouraged them to complete a course, finish a semester, or graduate from college, and describe how they encouraged them.

The winning contestant will win $1000. Another $1000 will go to the faculty/staff/administrator featured in the essay and a complimentary 2012-2013 NISOD membership will be given to the student’s college ($1000 value.)

The contest is in honor of Scott Wright, past editor of Community College Week (1995-2000), recipient of the 1998 Award for Excellence in Higher Education Journalism, and the reporter who brought national attention to developmental education and the unique mission community colleges possess in providing an accessible education.
