More than 1,000 high school freshmen converged on the campus of Arizona Western College on Feb. 20 for the annual Career Expo. Yuma High School, Vista Alternative School, Yuma Catholic High School, Kofa High School, Aztec High School, Cibola High School, Carpe Diem, and Antelope High School were all represented.

Once students got on campus, they were greeted by student leaders such as Ambassadors and Student Government Association (SGA) officers. The Expo is a great way to experience for students still in high school to get a feel for what college is like. Bringing them out and giving them a tour of the campus motivates them to at least consider going to college, hopefully even as a step toward going on to university study.

The Expo featured outdoor booths by the Technology 4 building parking lot. The Welding Business and Culinary Arts programs as well as the Yuma Police and Fire departments were on hand to advise students on their career choices.

"Schools should get more involved so that students can be motivated to go to college," said Jorge Pizano, SGA VP of Finance. "Besides that, the Expo is good because it shows students different career options and helps them ask questions and be better informed for the future."

Pizano, who co-hosted a pep rally in the Gym for the students, gave examples of how to be involved and demonstrated ways to interact with AWC student leaders. Students were introduce to important people from the college who might help them later if they are attend AWC. The student played games and participated in other activities with the Yuma Fire Department and with the AWC basketball and cheer teams.

Some students said they enjoyed the Expo but that the funnest part was the pep rally. One student in particular said that the AWC mascot, Andale the Bull, was a big inspiration.
