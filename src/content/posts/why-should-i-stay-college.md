College is an opening to thousands of opportunities. So why are people skipping out?

More than ever, attending college provides a far brighter future for graduates than for those who have not received a higher education. The reason so many high school students are not moving forward may be related to money. Obviously, getting a higher-paying job appeals to everyone, but the process of getting that degree is throwing people off.

The cost of tuition is also a big issue. This year most tuition fees in colleges and universities across the U.S. are expected to rise and some students just don’t have the money. There are some solutions to the cash problem, however, that most people don’t take advantage of.

College loans and scholarships are money solutions that many potential students overlook and are the reason why some current college students drop out. But, going to college will be the best investment anyone will ever make!

High school graduates today are obtaining fewer high-paying jobs than were once available. The U.S. has been transformed into an economy based on knowledge, so the importance of a college education today is greater than it was many years ago.

When students experience higher education they have the opportunity to read books and listen to the lectures of top experts in their field of choice. With the knowledge they gain here, they will begin to think more and ask questions while at the same time exploring new ideas and options available to them that they never had access to previously.

While obtaining a specialized degree is necessary in some fields, sometimes just having a college education is an advantage, regardless of the field of study. Employers want to know that their employees have a well-rounded basic education. The advantages of a college degree will be proven when your resume is chosen over those who did not make the commitment to complete their education.

Job seekers will also find that positions that may not actually require a college education will still pay more to those who have a degree. Job seekers with a college education will also earn higher salaries, even when the degree is not directly required for the job. The jobs that do not require a college education often have fewer benefits with no retirement benefits or health insurance which are imperative to financial security and the stability of the family.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported that “In 2003, workers who had a bachelor’s degree had median weekly earnings of $900, compared with $554 a week for high school graduates – that is a difference of $346 per week, or a 62 percent jump in median earnings.” These figures are a bold statement that the advantage of a college degree is its increased earning power. If you are determined and hard working, you can complete your education and begin a career that will provide now and pave the way to a secure retirement.
