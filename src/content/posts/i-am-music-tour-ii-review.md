Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross and Travis Barker are all well known on the billboard charts. But, to read a name on a billboard chart or listen to a number one single on an IPod is nothing compared to the magic that took place on stage during their I Am Music II tour that traveled through Arizona recently. From the unknown openers to the main artist, every person who performed was enthusiastic and showed their compassion and love for music.

Travis Barker went out and killed it on his drums, going from beat to beat and mixing beats with a DJ. His talent showed as he switched his drumsticks from hand to hand in the middle of playing, throwing them in the air and even taking off his shirt.

Following Travis Barker was well known rapper Rick Ross. Ross sang his newest song Hustler, then began playing his slower hits for the female crowd. On stage he was nothing short of what his music and videos portray him as -- a talented emcee with a love for lyrics.

Although Lil' Wayne and Nicki Minaj teamed up for their performance, the set definitely came off. Between them, back-to-back number-one hits came blaring out of the speakers. Minaj's dancers and background singers made everything absolutely Barbie-like. And her hype man, Safari, stayed close, making sure the crowd was energetic and ready to dance.

Wayne dominated the stage with mainstream songs that have peaked on billboard charts and mix-tape songs that are known worldwide. He had the crowd rocking, the speakers knocking and the band behind him going crazy with talent the whole time.

Highlights of the event included Minaj picking a person out of the audience during her performance to give a lap dance to. Steve Nash's face was a slam-dunk.

The day after the concert Nash tweeted to Minaj, "So it is real," and that it is! The music is real, the show is real, and the compassion and the love are real. That was the sentiment of the crowd throughout the show.
