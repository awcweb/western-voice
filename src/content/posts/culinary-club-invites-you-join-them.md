The Arizona Western College Culinary Club would like to invite all students, staff and faculty members that are interested to come join them at their next meeting, Nov. 16th at 5pm in room LR-109. You do not have to be in the Culinary program to join.

The club is planning many exciting fundraisers this year, including the Yuma Territorial Prison, Hospice of Yuma, Yuma Fun Art Association.(Romancing the Night),. The Club will join with the Culinary Dept for the Field or Feast and Lettuce Day Feastable Dinner and will work many different booths for two days after the Feastable Dinner.

The Culinary Department will be doing many formal dinners such as Doctor vs Doctor and the SkillsUSA competion. Last year students from the culinary classes won the gold, silver, and bronze medals for local and state competitions.

The culinary department and club are not part of the CTE Department. Any money that comes to the club/dept is made by donations and fundraisers. Please come and help support this fun group.

If you would like more information, please contact Kim Childs, Culinary Club President at 928-366-8688.
