As the lines at the San Luis Rio Colorado border crossing have gotten longer and longer over the years, the venders have multiplied. In the winter, with more people crossing to work in the fields, the wait can be as long as three hours.

These long lines have created a bustling market of street vendors.

Some vendors, like Sergio Valente Lopez, or "El Abuelo", have been working here for the past 50 years.

With everything from ice cream to homemade hair accessories, the vendors help make the painful wait a little more tolerable. A traveler can even order food from one of the many restaurants and food trucks without even leaving their vehicle.

It may not be ideal to wait in line for hours everyday, but don't worry. These enterprising vendors have you covered.
