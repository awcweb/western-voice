Arizona Western College was buzzing with anticipation as students, parents, college staff, local citizens and industry representatives all waited for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to arrive in the "solar nexus," as AWC director of Public Relations and Marketing Lori Stofft described the covered parking lot in front of the 3C Building.

Around 2:00 p.m., the governor arrived to a standing ovation. Stofft began the ceremony by introducing AWC president, Dr. Glenn Mayle, who in turn welcomed the governor, board members and distinguished guests.

As Dr. Mayle spoke about the solarproject being an exciting educational opportunity and a catalyst in Yuma's economic growth, he was accompanied by the sound of the solar panels. He said that the loud mechanical noises are normal and referred to them as a "solar symphony."

Governor Brewer took the podium and began by saying that she was "thrilled to be here" at the "oldest community college in the state." She also congratulated the AWC football team on a great season and said that, with continued teamwork, they were sure to go all the way next year.

Brewer said that the panels would lead to energy independence, helping Arizona toward its goal of doubling the number of B.A. degrees, and closed her remarks by calling AWC "the model for the rest of our state, even the country" in solar technology.

Jonathan W. Postal, founder and senior vice president of Business and Development and Government relations at Main Street Power, said nearly 100 percent of the energy used to power AWC during the day would come from these solar panels. AWC has signed a 30-year agreement with Main Street Power, the financiers of the solar panel project.

Postal asked Alfonso Dominguez, president of the AWC Science Club, to come up and be presented with solar curriculum materials, including a CD-rom, which Postal said were worth approximately $25,000.

Pat Dinkel, vice president for Arizona Public Service (APS) also spoke as well as Bruce Mercy from PPA Partners, a solar development company.

Dr. Mayle and Governor Brewer then went to an electrical box set up on the podium and officially "Flipped the Switch" to begin the 30-year usage of the solar panels.

Following the ceremony, inside one of the 3C conference rooms were food and beverages as well as free orange-and-blue t-shirts, provided by Main Street Power, that read, "The Sunniest City in the World Goes Solar."

Next was a question-answer session, moderated by Dave Riek, general manager of the campus radio station, KAWC. The Q&A panel included Mercy, Postal, Bill Smith (AWC project host), Rex Stepp of APS Utility, David S. Lincoln of Rosendin Electric, Eric Romo of Green Volts Inc., and Nancy Hartsoch of SolFocus.

The panelists talked about the new curriculum, which will include an occupational certificate, an A.S. degree and workforce training. They also spoke about how they all came together to create this project on the AWC campus.

After the Q&A, AWC provided a bus tour to anyone interested in viewing the five solar arrays set up by Green Volts Inc., SolFocus, Sharp, SolarWorld and Suntech. Lori Stofft spoke briefly about the panels and how they differed from each other as the bus passed by each array.

Flip the Switch was a monumental day in the history not only of AWC but of the entire state.
