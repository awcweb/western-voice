Arizona Western College is hosting the Fourth Annual "Parade for the Planet" Sustainability Fair on Thursday, April 21nd. The opening ceremony begins at 9:00 in the courtyard of the Science building. The demonstrations and speakers will begin shortly after that.

In joining the global effort toward a sustainable future, the fair encourages students to provide their own ideas for a greener future. "Let's come up with solutions to these problems and others!" Ted Martinez, AWC Professor of Biology, commented during the 2009 fair. "If we are truly to be global; we must think globally and act globally."

The clubs and programs that are participating in the event this year include the Student Government Council (SGA), Science Club, Computer club, SOTE and the Psychology club.

Over 700 area students attended last year's event to learn how to be friendlier to our planet. Participants learn how everything we do in this disposable society makes a difference, from shaving to building houses. There are alternatives that would make the world a much healthier place to live. A few of the activities planned are solar cooking demonstrations and recycling games.

The Sustainability Fair is presented by AWC students, faculty and staff and sponsored by

Allied Waste, AWC Honors, AWC Sustainability Council and APS.

"Join AWC in creating a sustainable vision for the future. Let's Go Green! "Professor Martinez said.
