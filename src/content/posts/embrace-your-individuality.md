Seeking assistance for a disability is not something to be ashamed of.

Arizona Western College's AccessABILTY office, located on the second floor of the 3C Bldg., has a kind staff who are always on their toes to assist those who have a disability or who need assistance during class hours.

"I really enjoy my position," says secretary Anna Obeso, who waits with a bright smile at the front desk. "Although not many people come by, I'm ready to help anyone in need."

The AccessABILTY office can be quite lonesome, says Obeso, due to people not having the courage to come and talk about their disability.

Laura Sandigo, the services coordinator, encourages people to not be ashamed of any kind of disability they may have. With passion in her eyes and a happy-go-lucky attitude, Sandigo hopes that more students will come in to take advantage of those services.

"We don't get high school documents, so we are not aware of what the person may need," says Sandigo, who stresses that all documentation is kept private.

AWC is full of diversity, and community college is an ideal place to begin making the world a better place.
