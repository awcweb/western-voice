With the holidays already upon us, it’s easy to overlook basic precautions that can go a long way in keeping your person and property safe. While no one ever expects to be robbed, assaulted or murdered, it does happen – even in Yuma.

According to the2010 crime statistics, released by the Yuma Police Department, the most recent year that data is available, this area had at least one serious/violent crime incident in all categories, including criminal homicide, forcible rape, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, arson and simple assault.

To avoid having to fill out police reports, trying to replace or recover stolen property, sitting in the hospital emergency room or worse, the Tucson Police Department offers the following suggestions for staying safe during the holidays and all year.

Pay attention

With so much happening, it’s easy to become distracted, especially when you are rushing around and carrying packages. This is the time to put the cell phone, tablet, MP3 player and whatever other electronic gadget that grabs your attention away.

You are a perfect target walking through a parking lot or anywhere else if you can’t hear or are unaware of your surroundings. Wait until you are in your car with the doors locked or back in your residence hall, your classroom or an area of the store where you can focus on what’s going on around you before you make or take that call or text.

Paying attention also means noticing where you park and taking a quick look under your vehicle as you approach and in the backseat before you get in. Be aware of vehicles parked near yours. If anything seems suspicious, it’s better to feel silly than sorry: Ask a security guard or store personnel to escort you to your car if you don’t feel safe.

Be prepared

The Boy Scouts are not the only ones who benefit from this advice. Have your keys out and easily accessible. You don’t want to be rooting around in your purse or fumbling through your pockets looking for your keys in the event someone is watching you, and you can even use your keys as a weapon if necessary.

Carry a whistle or a personal alarm or both – anything that can startle an attacker, draw attention and allow you to get away.

If you have a car with a key fob that has a panic button or can activate a noisy alarm, use it. Carrying a legal protection device like pepper spray or mace is a good idea, but make sure that it’s operational and that you know how to use it so it doesn’t end up being used on you.
