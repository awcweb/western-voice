"Poetry in the Grass." Well, more like "Poetry on the Concrete." But that's okay, the terrain wasn't the point of the event. Cool cats, beatniks and vaudevillians came together for a day of leisure and relaxation, judgment not necessary. And at least chairs were provided.

These artists came from all walks of life. There were the young and the not-so-young, students and teachers, women and men, boys and girls, gay and straight to share their original work and showcase their poetic sensibililty.

Put together by Kellsey Jane and Brycea Pacheco, president and vice-president, respectively, of Southwest Writers Alliance of Arizona Western College (SWAAWC), this event took place Oct. 16 on the AWC campus, in the 3C courtyard next to Starbucks.

This gathering's crop of poets featured Stephanie Stone, Seth Sanders, David Coy, Rebecca Goekler, Earl Smith, Arianna Carreno, Sheri Magdaleno, Lori Stofft, Dr. Eric Lee, and Lane Chipkin, among others.

Emotions were high, and listening was intense, as the poets poured their hearts out with the art of the written word. Clearly there is a lot of unsung talent here in the local community.

Seth Sanders, a 14-year-old high school student, shared a moving meditation about unrequited love and the anxiety that comes with it in his poem "Dear A."

"At 10, I got into reading, and I really liked it," said Sanders. "I thought, I can do this myself, so I started by writing poetry because it's short and sweet."

Other poems included "The Burial" by Professor Emeritus David Coy, about his 93-year old mother; "G.D.E.F.A.R." by Rebecca Goekler, about the ups and downs of life; "Son to Father" by ESL Professor Earl Smith about the trials and tribulations of being a good son and father; and "Thank You, Sir" by Kellsey Jane about gender misconceptions and stereotypes.

Many of the poems pulled at the heartstrings, but not all. Stephanie Stone testified to the lighter side with her vivacious and jaunty poem, "Journey of Pillows," as did Sherri Magdaleno with "Ode to NYC," a colorful and descriptive piece about life growing up in The Big Apple.

In the end, the poets got to showcase their jaw-dropping improvisational skills by reciting poems based on five random words they were given to piece together on the spot.

"We try to put on these events at least once or twice a semester -- just for fun, really," said Jane. "I'm not sure when we're planning the next one. Probably for Family Night."

We'll be watching for the fliers, and hope for a softer cushion next time.
