So far, so good, for the AWC men's basketball team this season.

After splitting their first four games this year, the Matadors have been a force to be reckoned with.

Despite some injuries and some uneven play, the Mats went on an impressive run by winning 16 of their next 17 games before a two-game hiccup in late January.

Making their record even more impressive is the job Head Coach, Charles Harral, has done in getting the most out of his re-tooled roster. "Anytime you've got a bunch of guys coming in from high school that have never played college basketball, it's an adjustment for everybody," said Harral.

The Mats have only two returning players from last season. Point guard, Anthony Alston, has been one of the team leaders this year, and Ivan Uribe, a sophomore forward out of Guadalajara, Mexico has been giving the team valuable minutes. "Take those two out of the equation, everyone else is a freshman," said Harral.

This may explain why this talented team has not played up to their own expectations towards the end of the season.

"I think we got a little over-confident because we had been winning so much," said freshman forward, Ross Buchman. Buchman, who hails from Albuquerque, NM, has been in and out of the starting lineup and has been a major contributor.

"Our teamwork has suffered a little lately, but we're working our way out of that," said Buchman.

Freshman forward, Brandon Lovings, also said teamwork has been an issue of late, but thinks it's just a by-product of a long, grinding season that is taking its toll on the squad. "I think we just got a little mentally fatigued. It's a long season and we have a lot of practices, games, school-work, classes and so-on. I think we just got a little mentally worn down, and that has led to some sub-par play," said Lovings.

Both Buchman and Lovings, however, have no doubt that the team will get back to playing the way they had been.

Part of the reason for the Mats success has been freshman guard, Ron Lee. Son of former Phoenix Suns legend, Ron Lee Sr., the sharpshooting Lee has been near the top of team leaders for scoring and three-point shooting.

Ali Faruqbey, a freshman guard out of San Leandro, Calif., has also been a bright spot for the Mats. He leads the team in scoring and was named ACCAC player of the week on Dec. 10. Lee was also named conference player of the week on Jan. 14.

With the playoffs fast approaching, the Mats are working to fine-tune their play and get back to winning basketball. There is still a lot left to play for in the regular season.

These Mats are slowly regaining their confidence and are poised for a post-season run. "We still have a chance to win our conference and get the number one seed," said Harral.
