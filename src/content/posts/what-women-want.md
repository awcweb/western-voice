In modern culture, the old costume of feeling sincerely appreciated by men appears to be lost. While reap artists tell us what they would like to do with women in imaginative and creative ways, the true desires of women are far from the artists' conception.

While we are in the midst of the 21st century, many men have taken on primitive characteristics -- you know, like mating with numerous women to fulfill survival instincts. In fact, this mentality in an already over-populated world couldn't be further away from what women of today really want and need. Just like the fight or flight response we developed to survive tiger attacks back then, our sexual instincts also need to be tamed down. The majority of the time, we don't need such instincts,anymore, as psychiatrists have discovered while studying domestic violence which plagues couples of all races and economic status.

Some facts on domestic violence:

One in every four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime.

An estimated 1.3 million women are victims of physical assault by an intimate partner each year.

85% of domestic violence victims are women.

Historically, females have been most often victimized by someone they knew.

Females who are 20-24 year of age are at the greatest risk of nonfatal intimate partner violence.

Most cases of domestic violence are never reported to the police, and that does not include child abuse.

Good communication between partners seems to be the key to stopping domestic violence, a fairly new concept in a very old world. Whatever happened to the man who took off his jacket and let his lady wear it because she was cold, opening a door for a woman, appropriate language around feminine company, or even pulling out her chair at the dinner table? For awhile, it seemed like men were getting it. They seemed to know how to treat a lady. But, in todays culture, it appears that those days are long gone.

As a woman, I can tell you that most of us wish that those days were still here. So, men, I have a message for you: If you think women want to be grabbed to get their attention, you're wrong! If you think speaking to a woman like you would speak to your hunting dogs -- "come here," "fetch," "jump" -- or if you think a women wants to be treated like your fellow BUD you are sadly mistaken.

Let me tell you what most women really want. Most women want to be spoken to in a genial manner. They want to be protected and covered by your strength. Most women want to be valued in a way that says, "I am important to you." But, most of all, women want the same thing men want: to be R- E- S- P -E -C - T- E --D!
