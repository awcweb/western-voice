College students are always looking for scholarships to help pay for school. Young women may not think of a scholarship being in the form of a beauty pageant, but those who compete could earn up to $4,000 in scholarship money.

Unlike the overdone glamour among the more popularized pageants, the Cinderella pageant stresses “age appropriate” dresses. Partywear in Cinderella (ages 3-12) should be something a girl would wear to a special event or wedding. ”Glitz” type “pageant dress” is not acceptable. Teen girls dress as they would for a prom.

Sahreena Munoz, the director of the program for the past two years, is an AWC student. Long before she was a student, or even the director, she was a contestant herself at the young age of three. She competed for more than 18 years. She took over the director position from her father, who was the director in Yuma for 10 years.

Contestants start at a local level and compete for numerous scholarships. Not only is it fun, but teaches a young lady to speak, act and, above all, gain self-confidence.

The local pageant in Yuma is held every March followed by the Arizona state finals in June. The program is for girls ages 3 to 17, and young women ages 18 to 26.
