When I got dressed this morning I noticed that I really hadn't been wearing a lot of the stuff that was taking up my closet. A lot of it was out of style or had just been outgrown. Regardless, I needed less clutter in my life.

So, I filled up three trash bags of clothes and headed for the Crossroads Mission. I got there and was, as always, taken aback by the number of people. I knew that my donation of summer clothes was going to come in handy and be well appreciated.

This faith-based organization was founded in 1959 with $50 by a man named Tom Reeves, who implemented his "3 S's" -- SOAP, SOUP and SALVATION. Currently our Yuma Mission is home to more than 25 families, and every three-day period it houses more than 100 people of many descriptions -- male and female, alcoholics and drug addicts. Along with showers and clothes, the Mission provides breakfast, lunch and dinner every day for anyone in the community who simply has nowhere else to go.

After I had delivered my bags of clothes a girl came up to me and asked if I had anything "fancy" in the bags. She said she had just gotten her first job and had no nice clothes to wear, adding that she had been living at the shelter and had no money. Did I mention that she's 16?

My eyes teared up at her story. Here was a homeless teenager who had been taken in by the Mission, clothed and fed, and who would now be able to get a job and get her life on track. This is why the organization exists -- to get people on their feet, no matter what their age or why they're there.

So my weekly challenge for my reader is: Go through your closets and clean out your shoes, socks, pajamas and anything that doesn't fit you and make a trip to the Mission. With summer rolling around, what better place to donate those unused items?

For those of you who are secret clothes hoarders and couldn't imagine getting rid of anything, than go through your cabinets. Any toiletries that have gone unused or food you have a more of than you need, make it your mission to donate it to the Mission

As any non-profit would say, anything helps. Every item of clothing, every can of food or any amount of money can impact someone who is less fortunate. You might even feel motivated to volunteer your time and energy because, in the end, that feeling of satisfaction that you're truly making a difference in the community and in someone's life is something to strive for.
