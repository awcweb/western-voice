Dear Campus,It is my honor to announce that the 2014 Southwest Ag Summit will be held at Arizona Western College on Feb. 26 and 27. In addition to preparing our students for jobs in agriculture, this is a unique opportunity for a deeper understanding of the critical role agriculture plays in our community.The 2014 Southwest Ag Summit will set up on Feb. 25. What this means to you is that we will welcome more than 200 local students, agriculture industry representatives, the public and more than 90 vendors to the Yuma campus.Some Agriculture and Science Building classes will be relocated so that classrooms are available for the Ag Summit break-out sessions. Parking lot P-1 will be closed Tuesday through Thursday of that week.Several AWC student clubs including the Ag Club, the Math Club, the Engineering Club and the Science Club will serve as ambassadors for this massive event. The 3C conference rooms will be utilized for sessions. Tractors, large equipment and a variety of farm machinery will be on display outside.The planners deeply appreciated your efforts when the summit was successfully hosted at AWC for the first time last year. Although there may be minor inconveniences, I thank you for recognizing the overall positive impact the Summit has on our campus and on our community.-President Mayle
