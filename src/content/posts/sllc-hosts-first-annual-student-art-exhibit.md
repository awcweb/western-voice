Students enrolled at the San Luis Learning Center put on a fun art exhibit to finish off the spring semester.

Julie Floss, Professor of Fine Arts, displayed work from art majors and non-majors. It was the third art exhibit of the semester in the SLLC, but the first annual exhibition by Arizona Western College students in San Luis.

The art exhibit had about 15 art pieces with different themes, using different materials such as graphite, charcoal and colored pencils. The artists attended the closing reception and articulated their ideas behind their pieces to the spectators present.

One of the art pieces that drew attention wasPhases of Life,composed of charcoalby drafting major Vanessa Murrieta. The art shows five different phases of the moon, from left to right – first quarter, half and full, followed by another half and, finally, another quarter.

Murrieta explained that the idea behind her work was the phases of life.

“When you’re young, you exist but don’t know who you are yet,” Murrieta said. “The older you get, the more you get to know yourself. Then, someone comes into your life and makes you feel complete.”

The full moon sooner or later disappears because that person leaves one way or another.

Another piece,My Addiction,drawn with graphite by art major Alfredo Juarez, features four videogame characters – Yoshi, Shovel Knight, a Pac-Man controller next to Pac-man, and Mario.

Blue Emotion, also by Juarez, shows a couple colored with blue in front of a yellow background. The girl has her arm around the boy while her head lies on top of his head. Both have glasses on, but the boy is looking directly at the viewer while the girl looked to her right.

One viewer, Sahira Vega, said she appreciated that the artists had different ideas and inspirations.

“It is a very diverse exhibit,” she said. “There was something for everyone to like.”

Floss pointed out that it’s important to support the work of local artists. Displaying their art not only motivates them to continue doing it, but it may also inspire others to do so. Even if it’s only on the local campus, it means a great deal to an artist that their work gets recognition and that they see others enjoying their work.

Floss herself is passionate about supporting local artists, and her students appreciate professors like her. She certainly plans to continue displaying their fine work.
