AWC was awarded four marketing awards at the National Council for Marketing & Public Relations Pacific Region meeting in Tempe, Ariz. NCMPR is a national association of marketing and public relations professionals at two-year colleges. The awards AWC won include:

Gold, Merchant of Venice poster, Scott McKeogh, College Publications

Silver, "Turn It Off" Marketing Campaign, Scott McKeogh, College Publications

Silver, TV Ad "Fall Register Now", Travis Mitchell, TV Services

Bronze, TV Campaign "Parker/Quartzsite: We're Here for You", Travis Mitchell, TV Services

The regional gold award in the poster category was the second in two years for graphic designer Scott McKeogh, who won gold last year with his "One Too Many" Alcohol Awareness poster. McKeogh has been working in graphic design at AWC for five years.

The Pacific Region includes schools in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah, Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia, Palau, Marshall Islands and Guam.

Travis Mitchell, who has worked as a Television Producer at AWC for 11 years, is also a repeat winner, having brought home a variety of awards over the years for both his marketing and institutional videos.

AWC staff will be submitting entries to the national award competition later this fall.
