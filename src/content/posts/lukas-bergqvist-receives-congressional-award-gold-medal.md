Lukas Bergqvist, an AWC studio art major, was recognized by AWC President Marc Nigliazzo on Tuesday, April 13, for winning the U.S. Congressional Award Gold Medal.

The Congressional Medal represents the highest expression of national appreciation for achievement. Lukas completed his journey in 2009 at age 23, after six years. In that six years he was required to do 400 hours of volunteer service hours, plus 200 hours of personal/physical development and a four-day expedition.

Lukas began his voluntary work by building houses in Yuma with Habitat for Humanity, but quickly found he really enjoyed helping young people more. “I learn from them probably as much as they learn from me,” he said in his thick Swedish accent. He began instructing students in the martial art of Jujitsu Kai in Sweden, where he was raised until about the age of 12. He also became a Boy Scout leader for Troop 8222 in Yuma.

To complete his personal development, Lukas started learning salsa dancing at AWC, but a full-time student cannot count hours in school toward the award. So, when he saw Russian ballet dancer Pavel Romanyu in a performance, he knew he would really enjoy doing that himself. He decided to audition for the Arizona Classical Ballet Company of which Romanyu is co-owner. Lukas’ first performance was as a parent in the Nutcracker in 2006; a fitting role for this excellent role model for young people.

In his final quest, Lukas had to complete an excursion/expedition and he chose Lake Immeln, Sweden, which has 365 islands and a lot of wilderness. He spent four days exploring the islands in a canoe with his youngest brother, 17-year-old Kani. “That probably wasn’t something I would have done had it not been for the congressional award, so it was something I, not just enjoyed, but it was an experience I would not have had otherwise,’ he said. “In the beginning, I thought it was going to be just canoeing. I had no idea what it would actually be like. Then, when my brother and I were trying to find where to sleep for the night on the islands, we found that it was really interesting just canoeing and exploring. I really liked the exploring because that was something I’ve always wanted to do since I was little.”

Lukas has a dual citizenship with both Sweden and the U.S. He likes to go back to Sweden in the summers, but “it gets pretty cold in the winter,” he said. “I get homesick both ways because I do a lot here and that’s why I enjoy it. But, I grew up there and I have friends there as well. So, it’s very difficult for me to just have one. I like both (places).”

When I asked Lukas about his most memorable experience he had a difficult time coming up with anything in particular. “The entire experience was nice. I can’t define just one because they all just kind of blend into a whole. Volunteering was always fun; I like teaching Jujitsu Kai a lot.”

For now, Lukas says he is focusing on his studies in Studio Art, learning how to improve his style, and he hopes to get his Associates degree next year. In his free time, Lukas enjoys watching movies. “I haven’t told (Dr. Miller) that,” he laughed as he referred to his film studies professor. He also likes riding his bike with his brothers. He plans to continue his volunteer work with the Boy Scouts and also ballet dancing. “I really like ballet,” he said.

“The volunteer work is very nice and I recommend that a lot of people try it,” Lukas suggested. When I mentioned the hectic schedules that most of us have that deter volunteerism, Lukas understandably had an amused expression on his face. Busy doesn’t seem to be a very good excuse to this accomplished fellow who never seems to tire of lending a helping hand.

Congratulations, Lukas, on your inspiring achievement; may you continue to have all your dreams come true.
