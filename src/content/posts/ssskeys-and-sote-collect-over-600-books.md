The Student Support Services (KEYS) Program and Club SOTE (Seek Opportunities Through Education) are hosting a reading tomorrow, March 15, in conjunction with National TRiO Day at the Rancho Viejo Head Start Center located at 930 S Avenue C between 10 am and noon.

“The reading is in conjunction with National TRiO Day which is in February, but we choose to do something a month later every year for a school in our community,” said Laura Shepherd, representative for the KEYS Program.

“This year is the 5thannual reading with TRIO Day that we have sponsored, “Laura said. “The first year we started by donating about 125 books, and now this year, we have been able to collect over 600 books!” All of the students will be able to take home at least one book for themselves.

“We are very excited because we could not have done it without the campus community and everyone who has donated to our book drive this year!”

A big thank you to everyone involved in this awesome project.
