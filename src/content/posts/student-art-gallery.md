Arizona Western College art scholars had the privilege of hosting their semester art exhibition. The show consists of over a dozen students’ works and is used to celebrate their achievements throughout the semester.

The gallery reception, held on Nov. 29 in the AWC Art Gallery, also included poetry readings in the green grassy area in front of the building, and was followed by the release of the Colorado Crossing literary journal.

Art Professor William Blomquist, the current Gallery director, was very proud of all the students’ hard work.

“It gives me joy to see the students arrange and display everything themselves,” said Blomquist. “I was just in charge of bringing in the pizza, which by the way everyone loved.”

The exhibit featured all types of media, including acrylic, sculpture, print, clay, oil and pastel.

Out of the wide range of artworks, one stood out – Anna Jarocki’s 9th Wonder of the World, a mysterious black-and-white pastel portrait of a woman. The woman’s ethnicity is ambiguous, so the viewer can interpret it however they choose.

One creepy but interesting piece was Madeline Olson’s acrylic titled Jaundice John, a portrait of a wide-eyed man with devilish red skin tone and bushy eyebrows. His bright yellow eyeballs and green and black pupils feel as if they are staring deep into your soul.

Priscilla Huerta had an eye-catching work on display, an untitled monoprint, which is a form of printmaking consisting of a single line. Against a violet background of some leaves are some forest green leaves in the shape of what appears to be a heart. What could this breathtaking image mean?

“It had a very chill feeling to it, just walking around with a cup of tea looking at the arts,” said AWC nursing student Sandy Palomino. “It is a very fun way to spend some time if you love art like I do,”

“Out of all the pieces, I have to say I really loved the mini sculpture of rapper, 21 Savage.” said English major Melissa Razo. “It is kind of symbolic how half of his face is white and the other half is his normal dark skin tone.”

The Gallery is open during the semester, Monday through Friday. For more information, contact Professor Brad Pease at 928-344-7707 or brad.pease@azwestern.edu.
