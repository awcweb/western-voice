The new 18,351 square foot Student Success Center officially celebrated their grand opening with a ribbon cutting ceremony Monday, September 13, 2010 from 4:00-5:30 p.m. Vanessa Natesway, director for the Student Success Center, began the ceremonies by introducing guest speakers AWC President Dr. Glenn Mayle, Dr. Marj Barcomb, Chair person for the District Governing Board, Professor of Math Ann Gallagher, and staff liaison for the writing center, Dr. Ellen Reik.

”Because of technology, we’re actually building synaptic connection [in our brains]and we’re thinking differently,” Dr. Barcomb said during her speech, “These buildings have come together to help us [use] the technology; use our flexible [evolving] brains.”

After each speaker shared for their two minute limit, the Peer Tutors for the Student Success Center gathered around Dr. Mayle for pictures and the official ribbon cutting ceremony.

A fascinating tour through the classrooms was offered afterward with demonstrations of the new state of the art technology. The six digital classrooms each feature amazing smartboards which transfers handwriting on a whiteboard tocomputerdocument with the touch of a finger, high resolution data projectors, workstations with fold down computers screens, and software application. All of this is designed to encourage interactive learning. Other features available throughout the student success center are wireless networking with convenient on the floor outlets, tutoring space, an 18-seat video conferencing room for faculty conferences as well as classroom use, 32 laptop computers in each of the math and writing centers, ADA compatible computer access, and two sound proof conference rooms. Even though the SSC has been open for a while many students are not aware that the center offers these services.

Joanne Neil, a receptionist in the writing lab said, “At first we didn’t have a lot people show up. So during the first two weeks of school we had tutors going around to the English classes informing the students of the Writing Center. Since then we’ve had a lot more appointments, especially since some classes like Chemistry, Art History, and Music Appreciation require them to come. Once the students come they usually keep coming back.” Joanne goes on to say, “Most are afraid to show their work, but we’re not here to judge, we’re here to help.”

Mayra Castanera, an English tutor in the Writing Center said, “We get a lot of students who struggle with English and then we get those who are truly dedicated and want to improve on what they already know.”

In October of 2008, this was all made possible when AWC was chosen to receive 3.5 million dollars from the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (CCRAA) Grant. “The old writing lab was too small and it got noisy when there were more than two people in there. This new center is state of the art, it’s professional, and it’s supportive,” says Professor Riek.

The Math Center, on the west side of the building, opened on April 12th and is staffed with Peer Tutors, faculty and staff to help students, free of charge, individually, in groups or in workshops.

The Writing Center, on the East side of the building, opened on Monday, August 23rd and is also staffed with trained Peer Tutors, Faculty and Staff who are here to help students, also free of charge, at any stage of their writing process. The purpose of the Writing Center is to help students become capable and confident writers.

Professor Anne Gallagher, a math teacher, was brought in through the grant that made the new Success Center possible. She feels that the new technology, like the Smart Boards that allow the teachers to write on the board and email the notes to students, has an effect on how the students learn.

“Because of all this technology people are learning differently than they used to,” Professor Gallagher says. “With these Smart Boards students are more engaged. We want to change the way we teach so it’s more interactive versus straight lectures.”

Kathleen, another tutor at the writing lab has been tutoring there for three semesters. “Since the opening, “she said, “we’ve been getting a lot more people mostly because we have so much space now. Also, it’s a lot cooler than you think.”

The facility, with updated exterior shell physically and all code requirements, continues the districts commitment to a sustainable future. There are windows that have high tech, low-e glass, energy saving lights on occupancy sensors, waterless fixtures in the bathroom with touchless paper-towel dispensers, AC systems with air handlers to cut down on usage, and an overall low carbon footprint. Also, each space in the facility is easily converted for multi-use purposes.

The Writing Center is open Monday – Thursday from 8am-8pm, Friday from 10am -3pm, and Sunday from 5-8pm. Workshops on particular aspects of the writing process are also offered throughout the semester. Faculty, please encourage students to take advantage of these great FREE services in the beautiful new facility.
