Arizona Western College's first ever Mom's Night Out, sponsored by the Child Development Learning Lab (CDLL), was a unique event offered specifically to mothers attending AWC now or in the future. However, moms weren't the only ones in on the festivities. Husbands, children and women who didn't have kids were also welcome.

The event, a collaboration between two AWC offices -- Recruitment and Outreach Enrollment Services and PR and Marketing -- was held in the North Schoening Conference Center on Oct. 21. It focused on helping prospective and current students in applying for college and financial aid, choosing a major and understanding what it's like to be a student-mom.

Moms and their guests were treated to massages, appetizers, a photo booth and child-care services, all free of charge for an enjoyable experience and a much-needed break. There were also raffles throughout the evening with prizes like free hour-long massages, haircuts and eyebrow-threading sessions.

"I loved the free massages and all of the freebies they offered," said Gabby Ledezma, an early-childhood education major. "They are really taking care of us moms."

The booths featured various majors and career choices, ranging from culinary arts to massage therapy, and including many more such as math, nursing and information technology. Prospective students could ask questions and gather up information and quaint freebies.

"I love all the booths because I'm looking to come back to AWC, and I love how this whole event is focused on moms," said former student, Stacey Gernica.

"I was taken aback on how much info there was and the image of the school," said prospective Matador Silvia Bell. "I would never have guessed that they would do as much as they did. And offering free child-care services? That is a blessing."

Another prospective student, Elizabeth Rodriguez said, "I like this because it's a great opportunity for moms to get some time out and get focused on the future."

Guest speakers included AWC campus coordinators, directors and students, who all had one thing in common -- they were all moms. The point they wanted to get across was, even if you are a mother and lead a busy life, there is still an opportunity to go to college and find help getting started on a career.

"I am a mother of four, a stay-at-home wife and I hadn't attended college for 17 years," said guest speaker and current full-time AWC student, Brenda Doak. "I was busy with family life, but the staff at AWC helped me and walked me through the process of choosing a career path, and now I'm currently in the A.A.S. Paralegal Studies Program.

"There are opportunities out there for mothers with busy lives," said Doak. "I started out taking AWC's online courses and then eventually, even though I was nervous as heck, finally stepped into my first real classroom."

Another guest speaker, Maria Aguirre, director of Customized and Contract Training Services, advised the audience on how to get started and how to pursue a career at AWC.

"Age doesn't matter," Aguirre said. "College can be for everyone."

She showed inspirational quotes and videos as well as gave the audience career and majors pamphlets and brochures.

"Please take the opportunity to learn more about AWC," she said. "Don't be embarrassed to ask for help."

Other demonstrations involved women's self-defense courses, yoga, belly dancing and child karate as well as the programs offered at the AWC Entrepreneurial Center on Redondo Drive. They focused on showing the audience the variety of self-enrichment classes and the variety of AWC campus locations aside from the main one.

Mandy Heil from the office of Recruitment and Outreach Enrollment Services said, "There are a lot of different populations in Yuma County to inform, but Lori Stofft [director of PR and Marketing] and I thought moms would be a great group to target.

"I'm pleased with our first try, and I am glad that they've enjoyed themselves."
