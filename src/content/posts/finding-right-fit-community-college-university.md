Do you spend as much time trying on colleges as you do trying on jeans? With spring graduation just eight weeks away, it's important to invest time in determining what and where the right school is for you to be successful in your academic pursuit of a bachelor's degree.

A college is like anew pair of jeans

The fact is that jeans come in all shapes, sizes, fabrics, colors and prices. In order to find the perfect pair that fits just right, it's essential that you spend time going to stores to try jeans on. You might think you want a new pair of black jeans when the coolest pair of stone-washed cargo jean shorts, just your size, is hanging on the rack right next to those black jeans. Each pair has its own characteristics; and, until you actually try them on, you'll never really know whether they are right for you.

College campuses are very similar to jeans. It's important to invest the same energy and time in finding the right fit for you. Each college campus has its own student culture or "vibe" that is very different from the next.

Questions for finding that fit

College websites offer volumes of information that will give you a foundation of knowledge about the academic rigor and student life, but it's not the same as actually taking a tour and getting a feel for the surroundings. The only way to feel it is to actually visit the campus and learn about what makes it special.

Is the size of the campus what you were expecting? Do you see students on campus who look like they're happy and having fun? Does the campus have your program, and is the tuition affordable? Is the weather consistent with what you are used to, or are you looking for a change? Does the college offer NCAA sports teams and/or Greek life? Are there dorms for you to live in and a cafeteria that serves the kind of food you like?

Is the library open 24/7, and are there pizza shops that deliver late at night? Is there a coffee shop or a movie theatre nearby that suits your needs? Does the campus offer international travel or exchange programs? Is the student body diverse? Is sustainability important, and are there student government or local volunteer opportunities? How about performing and visual art opportunities?

All these questions are important for you to answer as you embark on finding a new school to complete your bachelor's degree.

Meet & greet

Every college in the nation has campus tours, information sessions and admissions "meet & greet" events throughout the year for prospective students (and parents) to learn more about them. I encourage you to schedule time to visit college campuses. Just like finding the right jeans, you'll know immediately when it's the right fit.
