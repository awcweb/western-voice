AWC Theatre has an incredible line up of productions and opportunities for the greater AWC community this semester.

The first production of the semester is the new and improved “Matadors of Comedy,” directed by AWC Theatre Student Alex Rico and will include sketch comedy along with the standard stand-up and improvisation. Rico also intends to have two shows a night: the early show for more family friendly fare, and the late show for the more adult and risqué brand of humor. Matadors will open Friday, September 23rd and 24th at the AWC Theater and the first show begins at 7:30 and the second show begins at 10pm (tentatively).

The second productionthis semester is Christopher Durang’s “The Baby with the Bathwater,” directed by AWC Theatre Student Amanda Carreno. ”Baby” opens at the AWC Theater on Friday, October 7th and closes Sunday, October 16th.

The third production is the ever popular “Rocky Horror Picture Show,” directed by AWC Theatre Student Laura Page Duppstadt. ”Rocky” will open Friday, October 28th at midnight and will close Saturday, October 29th after the midnight show. Last semester we had to turn audience members away, so get there early.

The final production of the semester is “Stand and Deliver” about the mid 1970′s inner city LA mathteacher Jaime Escalante and his calculus students who took the AP Math exams and showed the world that anyone can work hard enough to pass those exams. This production is directed by AWC Theatre professor Chip Straley, whose father was the lead table reader of those AP exams when the controversy erupted. “Stand and Deliver” will open Friday, November 11th and run Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday through Sunday, November 20th
