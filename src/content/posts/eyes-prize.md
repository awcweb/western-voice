There is a theory among successful coaches that the job requires filling many roles -- part-time mentor, parent, therapist, friend, psychologist, teacher and motivational speaker.

And somewhere along the line, being a coach comes into play.

High expectations

One might wonder how Jason Smith keeps his hair so perfectly coiffed while wearing so many different hats. Smith, head coach of the Arizona Western College volleyball team, appears to handle all these roles with ease.

However, there's a price to pay in knowing his team as intimately as he does. His expectations are "probably higher than I've ever had," he says. "This is one of the most athletic teams I've ever had."

And after their trip to the Region finals a year ago, the expectations for the Lady Mats are clearly defined. Anything short of a deep playoff run would be a disappointment. After all, the squad is taller, faster and more athletic than most teams they face.

"What we're really finding out right now is how determined and how focused we're going to be," explains Smith. "If we can pass some of those tests of being mentally sharp, then we're going to be really good."

A sense of comraderie

Part of the excitement for Smith is that his team is entirely comprised of players he and his staff recruited. Last season, half the team had been recruited by the previous regime, and there wasn't the same sense of camaraderie that there is this season.

"Last year, the sophomores and freshmen were kind of divided," explains sophomore outside hitter Paula Rosa. "This year we all get along. We trust each other pretty well out on the court and off it."

Rosa, from Curitiba, Brazil, has emerged as the Lady Mats anchor.

"She can perform every skill at a pretty high level," Smith says. "[Rosa is] definitely our best passer, probably our best defensive player, our best server, and she hits the ball pretty well."

Amanda Watkins, a sophomore middle blocker out of Los Angeles, has been another dangerous weapon for the Lady Mats. Last season, Watkins was First-Team All-Region and First-Team All-Conference as a freshman and has already been named Conference Player of the Week this season.

A special season

There is no question this team has the talent to make it a special season, but Coach Smith knows that nothing is guaranteed.

"We're figuring out right now how far we're going to go, how good we're going to be," he says. "There's no rule out there that says the best team always wins."

Rosa isn't shy about what the team's goals should be, saying, "If we keep working hard, we should go to Nationals."

There is much volleyball yet to be played, but the Lady Mats hope to add one more duty to coach Smith's ever-expanding repertoire -- that of championship parade-route planner.
