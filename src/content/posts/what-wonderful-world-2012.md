In an ecstatic celebration of global harmony, AWC International Programs and Student Activities presented the second annual dinner-theater event titled "What a Wonderful World: Talent from Distant Shores."

The purpose of this gala affair, held on March 9 in the Schoening Conference Center, was to showcase global connections and cultural diversity at Arizona Western College, raise funds for student trips and of course to provide an evening of entertainment. According to the sold-out audience response, all three goals were fully achieved. The foremost aspect of this show was the vibrant collaboration and commitment put forth by a great many students, Student Services staff members and community volunteers.

The buffet dinner was elegantly catered by Sodexho at tables festooned with the colors, flags, photos, informative displays and unique items representing various countries and cultures including the U.S.

Entertainment followed with a variety of songs and dances by a talented and energetic cast. The program featured a blend of traditions and pop culture from near and far, from Renaissance Italy to the corners of Africa, from our local border mix to Hip Hop, and from Country & Western to popular hits from China and Vietnam.

Besides the sponsorship by the International Programs and Student Activities programs, the production featured more than fifty students from I-Team, SGA, Club CRU, KEYS, MVP and CAMPSA. The lively show resulted from the combined efforts of Campus Events, Sodexho Catering, Facilities, Information Technology, Television Services, the Office of Diversity, Publications, PR & Marketing, Career Services and Student Support Services.

But the evening truly belonged to the performers, who entered the Hall and greeted the audience to the soulful standard by Luis Armstrong as the stage portrayed elements of a wonderful world.

MC's for the evening were Azucena Gonzalez and Joeffrey McCray. Beryl Lay opened the show with her haunting version of "Ave Maria." Liza Zvingowaniseyi of Zimbabwe, along with Prince Osemene and William Ozuma of Nigeria, provided a montage of information, song and dance portraying "Faces of Africa."

A soulful hip-hop dance by Edgar Bettencourt and Jessica Hubbard followed, and Tam Dang sang a patriotic song in his native language, "Vietnam, My Country," accompanied by a beautiful slide show. Club CRU, led by Shawnee Marie, portrayed the struggles of life and the role of faith through interpretive dance. Jhamiel Robles closed ACT 1 with her crowd-pleasing rendition of the old standard "Blue Bayou."

After a short intermission, ACT 2 opened with a dynamic International Fashion Show coordinated by the International Students Program. The First Christian Church supplied many of the traditional outfits with a footnote by Mayra Garate and KEYS students previewing their uniquely styled Recycled Fashions.

Then, Tam Dang returned with countryman Cuong Do to sing an upbeat duet, the Vietnamese hit "Beautiful Day." CAMPSA students led by Cristina Rivas whooped it up with border variations of the western line dance "Caballo Dorado." Chinese Students Menghua Liu, Xinyi Zou, with Vietnamese student Thao Nguyen and local student Kiera Woods, performed a popular hit from China in tongue-twisting Mandarin.

Jhamiel Robles returned to do Colby Caillat's "Bubbly," and the final performance came once again from Edgar Bettencourt teaming up with Shara Roberts with a dance tribute to Michael Jackson's "Beat It." The entire cast then took the stage to perform "United," a song that literally brought the world together on stage through the magic of video and the Playing for Change Band.

All in all, it was an evening of unbridled optimism and a celebration of global youth culture as these AWC students enthusiastically shared their talents and cultures.
