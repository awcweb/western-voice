Are you looking to start your acting career? Then audition for Status Quo, a student-made superhero film set right here in Yuma.

Pre-production

Director Alec Saunders and Co-Director Ammar Vermont have been collaborating with fellow students this semester to create the story of Aaron Dexter, a typical teen who contributes to today's crime. Saunders, Vermont and their colleagues plan to begin filming next semester.

"The film so far has been a blast," says Saunders. "I have one of the greatest teams I've ever known; we pull so tight and the vision is coming together so clearly."

Besides Saunders and Vermont, the team includes students Jose Gonzalez, Sarah Tuggle, Javier DeSantiago and Phillip Iloff.

"I look forward to the next step in making this movie with these people, and I wouldn't trade anyone in my team for the world," said Saunders.

Vermont, an inspiring filmmaker who recently returned to Arizona Western College from Mesa, has helped create the script.

"If ever there was a creation to manifest all that is divine and pure in this world, Status Quo has made its reverie," said Vermont.

Auditions

Several characters and extras still need to be cast for the film, and actors ages 18 and older are encouraged to audition.

Auditions will be held Wed., Nov. 24, from 12:15-1:30 p.m. at the AWC Theatre and should consist of a short monologue from any play or film. Memorization of the monologue is suggested but not required for the audition, and the director recommends the choice of a more modern monologue as an audition piece.

The directors and their colleagues will elaborate further on the film during a brief presentation before the auditions. Anyone interested but who cannot attend the designated audition time, should contact Saunders at 257-9979. Auditions set for Status Quo
