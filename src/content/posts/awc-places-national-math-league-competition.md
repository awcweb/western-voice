This year, Arizona Western College was a regional contender in the two-semester Student Mathematics League competition, an annual event sponsored by the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC).

"It was a very successful year both individually and as a team," said Daniel Russow, AWC professor of mathematics.

Cuong Do placed 3rd in the state of Arizona and 10th in the Southwest region, while the AWC team placed 3rd in the state and 5th in the region.

This year's team was coached by associate faculty member Luis Martinez. An awards ceremony to recognize the winners was held April 16 in the AS Building Lobby.

There are two parts to the national competition, which is administered locally in fall and spring. Math faculty grade the exams with instructions from AMATYC and then enter scores into a national database. Last year, more than 8,000 students participated nationally in this competition.

About 60 AWC students began the competition in the fall semester. In the local round, the top scorers were Cuong Do (1st place), Anthony Clayton (2nd), and Melissa Garcia and Manuel Lopez (tied for 3rd).

This year's competition was sponsored by Chicago Title Insurance Company, and by Dan Fauth, President/County Manager of Chicago Title Insurance, President of the AWC Foundation and Board of Directors member.
