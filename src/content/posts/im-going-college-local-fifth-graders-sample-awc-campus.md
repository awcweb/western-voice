The children wore bright-colored t-shirts with the numbers “2021.” They were separated into five color groups by NAU student leaders. The red and blue shirts were from Roosevelt, green, purple and yellow from Carver.

The event was meant “to open their eyes to a college campus, make them aware of possibilities,” said Alison Howell. “Some of the students today have not had any exposure to a college campus.”What made this event unique from any other field trip was that classes were specially made for these kids. Each group had three 20-minute classes, including Environmental Science, Nursing, and Graphics.

A full morning

At 9:10 a.m. the students arrived and entered the 3C building. “Robot Chef” was an interactive presentation where a “robot” was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

For each step in making the sandwich the children would eagerly raise their hands. This presentation showed the kids that if you take steps in life towards a goal, it is achievable. (Who knew there was twenty-three steps in making a PB&J sandwich?)

At 10:30 a.m. the children in purple entered one of the AWC classrooms where NAU professor Jerry R. Lewis gave them a 20-minute lecture in leadership. Lewis related to them by sharing stories and letting the students ask questions. Lewis had all the kids hysterically laughing. “If these fifth graders are late for class I will give them detention!” Lewis joked.

“If you dream it, it will happen and to think about yourself and others” said Carver student Luis after Lewis’ lecture.

At 11 a.m. the students had their brown bag lunch in the courtyard. For a minute an observer could almost forget that these students are all around ten years old. A buzz is all that could be made out from the students speaking and laughing at the same time.

Early Graduation

At 11:30 a.m. the yellow group had a crash course in fitness with a “Simon Says” game. The red group had music where AWC students displayed a few talents to the fifth graders. The blue group had Environmental Science where Dr. Martinez gave a lecture on recycling titled “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!”.

At 12 p.m. the red group had a science glass. The green group had graphics where the kids had the chance to Photoshop a picture of themselves. The yellow group had a lecture with Mr. Croxen over fossils. Croxen showed plastic replicas of skulls to the group and they guessed the animals. Afterwards he displayedpictures in the projector of animals the students were really intrigued to know more about.

Fifth graders received certificates in the usual ceremonial style

At 12:30 p.m. “Congratulations Future Graduates,” read the banner of the podium at the AWC Theater where students were each given achievement certificates. Alvina Johnson read through all the names of students in the same fashion as a real graduation; shaking with their right, receive the diploma with their left.

One bright student even asked since he has the certificate already does he need to go to school tomorrow?

“It’s only a certificate, but in 2021 your major will look similar,” Johnson replied.

What were you doing in fifth grade?

These fifth graders made their goals toward the year 2021, which is approximately when they would receive a major degree. The goals for two of the students were to become a lawyer and a nurse.

“Always got in trouble for talking,” said Alex, a Political Science Major at AWC, remembering her fifth grade experience. “In fifth grade they did not emphasis higher education.”

“I did not get to experience something as this,” said Brenda, an AWC Business Major. “You see the students expressions and I kind of wish I could have experienced this as a fifth grader- they look really happy.”

AWC President Marc Nigliazzo hosted similar events at other colleges and thought it would be a good idea to bring this affair to AWC. Alison Howell hopes to have this event “once a year or once every semester.”

A fun learning experience for these fifth graders at AWC.
