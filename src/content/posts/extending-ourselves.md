In mid-April, the Parker Learning Center of Arizona Western College hosted a certification program for Irrigation Systems Operators. This technical training opportunity was designed and sponsored by the United States Dept. of Agriculture and the Parker Valley National Resource Conservation District.

Support for the program came from local community partnerships, including those with Parker Learning Center, the AWC Continuing Education Division, La Paz County Career Center, University of Arizona Cooperative Extensive Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and Future Farmers of America (FFA).

By hosting this certificate program, AWC has strengthened its presence with the local community through training qualified workers who can provide safe and efficient operation and maintenance of canal operation in La Paz County, thus creating new and exciting employment opportunities.
