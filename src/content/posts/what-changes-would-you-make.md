What changes would YOU like to make at AWC?

The time has come to once again vote for Arizona Western College Student Government Association (SGA) officers. If you would like to see some changes take place at AWC, now is the time to make your voice heard.

The dedicated students of SGA are our greatest advocates for addressing student concerns, promoting a community atmosphere and providing a variety of fun, interactive activities on the campus. Voting is important because the SGA serves as the voice of the entire student body and helps make decisions for the benefit of current and future AWC students.

If you would like to campaign, you can pick up an application by April 12. The campaign runs from April 13-24th.

To vote for your favorite runner, pick up your packets at the Campus Life office in the 3c building. Then, stop by the eatery between 10-1 or the SC from 4-6 on April 25-26.

The winner will be announced on May 3 at 6:30 pm.

Your involvement in SGA helps to ensure that AWC remains sensitive to the views of its students, as well as continues to provide learning experiences for valuable leadership skills.

All AWC students are encouraged to participate in SGA and help strengthen Student Government!
