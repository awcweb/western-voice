How does a team top a season in which it went 11-1 and played in the National Championship game? The obvious answer would be by winning the national title, but maybe it's not that simple.

The 2011 version of Matador Football was something to behold. The team's only defeat was a narrow loss to East Mississippi Community College in the El Toro Bowl, which served last year as the junior college National Championship game. The Mats almost came back in that game, only to have their rally fall short. One could say the team didn't lose, they just ran out of time.

Bigger and better things

More than a dozen players from that squad went on to NCAA Division I programs following the season. Highlighting that group is Damien Williams and Chris Young.

Williams was both Western States Football League and Arizona Community College Athletic Conference offensive player of the year. He rushed for almost 2,000 yards and had a ridiculous 31 touchdowns.

Those numbers earned Williams a scholarship to the University of Oklahoma, where through the first few games he hasn't slowed down much. In a game against Florida A&M on Sept. 8, he rushed for 156 yards and 4 touchdowns.

Chris Young, an outside linebacker who had moved from safety the previous year, led the team with 111 total tackles and had 8.5 sacks. He also scored an unheard-of six defensive touchdowns in those 11 games. Young garnered WSFL and ACCAC Defensive Player of the Year honors for his standout season.

Fellow linebacker, Steffon Martin, who had 108 tackles and 7.5 sacks, joined Young in transferring to the Arizona State University defensive squad.

A whole new ball game

Needless to say, production like that is difficult to replace. But freshman quarterback Tanner McEvoy and sophomore wide receiver Andre O'Neil are doing their best to fill the void.

McEvoy, of Hillside, N.J., was named National Junior College Athletic Association Offensive Player of the Week on Sept. 23 following the Mats' 63-38 defeat of #9-ranked Scottsdale Community College, when McEvoy shredded the Fighting Artichokes' defense for 416 yards and 5 touchdowns.

One of McEvoy's favorite targets is O'Neil, who hails from Miami, Fla. O'Neil understands it won't be easy to duplicate last season.

"The team last year was better than this year's," O'Neil said. "The coaches think they still got the team from last year, but it's not. So they're trying to force things a little."

The road is long

It's understandable that the Arizona Western College coaches are anxious to get their team playing at a high level; they are accustomed to success, and they expect it.

The Matadors' #2 national ranking might help to ease some of the tension. The Mats began the season ranked #5 and have played well enough to impress the voters.

Sophomore linebacker Mike Dallas, also out of Miami, Fla., wasn't here last year but seems to know what it's going to take to bring AWC back to the title game.

"The dudes that were here last year have a real strong bond," Dallas said. "Everybody else sees that and wants to be a part of it, so they work extra hard to get where we want to be, and that's a national championship."

The Mats expect to match last year's team and then some.

"I expect greatness," O'Neil said. "Our definition [of greatness] is to get to the top, and we're going to get there."

The road is long and fraught with peril, but the 2012 Matadors are up to the challenge. When asked if this team can duplicate last year's trip to the title game, O'Neil doesn't hesitate: "Even better,\" said O'Neil. \"We're going to win it."
