Have something to say, but no where to say it? The Western Voice might be the medium for you.

The Western Voice is a website, replacing AWC’s standard newspaper format, where anyone affiliated with AWC can write articles, poetry, stories, comments or any composition for submission. Although the majority of articles are submitted by Journalism students under the guidance of Professor Michael Miller, it also offers a place to get your creative ideas flowing. Whether you delve into whims of fancy or earnest intent, the Western Voice is an excellent outlet to get your ideas out for others to read.

Professor Miller’s vision for the Western Voice is a cyber-center for campus affiliates which is different from the AWC home site because it invites correspondence rather than just informs. It is an environment that invites everyone’s opinion and ideas about what is going on around the campus. This new curriculum matches the more modern electronic media and, in fact, is currently working on expanding to other social sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some of the photos that are submitted by photography students are already on the affiliated Flickr site which you can access from the WV home site.

There are currently nine categories inside the Voice: Western Artists, News, Opinion, Sports, Video, Arts, Blogs, Featured, and the most recent, Western voice Radio. For current examples, the Western Artists site is where one can read short works of fiction by local writers; Arts, on the other hand, is about AWC Art Gallery and the artists who have submitted work to it. Other categories are self-explanatory, with articles ranging from opinions about texting while driving to history in the making with AWC’s solar installation news story.

Although the ‘Western Voice’ does not pay artist for their submissions, it does give a bit of notoriety and experience, important for success in the field of creativity. Students interested in the Journalism field can gain excellent inside knowledge of exactly how the business works.

Photos, graphics and videos are also welcome to the website for sharing and posting with article submissions. To submit your creative work to the Western Voice, email it toMichael.Miller@azwestern.edu for review.
