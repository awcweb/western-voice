The fourth annual Two Rivers Renaissance Faire made its way to the desert southwest on the weekend of February 5-7 at the West Wetlands Park.

The Faire was a great way to revisit the past when Shakespeare, merchants, blacksmiths and court jesters were the talk of the day. A variety of activities, performers and merchants were on hand to entertain guests as they walked around the Faire. Some of the entertainers included the duelists who combined action and comedy into a very funny routine. Along with the duelists, were magicians, jugglers, the AWC belly dancers, art exhibits, food vendors, a massage therapy class and many items being sold that were relevant to that time period, such as swords, handcrafted bags and authentic Renaissance-looking clothing. Since the event opened, it has grown to about triple its original size.

Most of the people who run the event are normal Yumans who volunteer their time to be a part of something truly unique and fun. Some of the townspeople dressed in costume come from Arizona Western Collegeâ€™s Theatre Department. The Theatre Professor, Chip Straley, taught fencing to all who were interested.

If you missed your chance to experience the incident, the Two Rivers Renaissance Faire will surely be back next year. Be warned though, to bring plenty of money since the entrance was $10 and the many exotic food/items cost a pretty penny.
