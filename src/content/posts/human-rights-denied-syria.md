About a year ago, Syrian citizens began their protests against the lack of freedom in their country. Their public demonstrations since then have been an attempt to achieve a new and better regime, beginning with the desired ouster of President Bashar-Al Assad.

Bashar refused to step down and quickly sent the military to stop the protests. Since then the military has been torturing and killing its own people.

One of the stories from Syria tells of a boy, whose father was against the regime, being beaten until he was swollen all over, then having his toenails cut off with sharp tools. The soldiers then cut the rest of his body into little pieces and sent them to his parents' house. His parents didn't know what happened to him until they received the box of flesh with a note attached to it saying that this was their son.

The Syrian city enduring the most violence is Homs, where reports say children are being kidnapped and murdered, people are being shot by snipers and hospitals are no longer reachable. Currently, Homs is surrounded by snipers and regime officers. Bashar-Al Assad is making sure no one gets out, no matter what the cost. There is no food to eat or water to drink. Hundreds are lining up in front of the bakeries merely to get a few pieces of bread.

Should America allow a dictator to kill his own people? Once a regime starts killing its own people without trial or any human rights involved, then it must immediately be dissolved. In order to protect our human rights we must first protect the people who are being denied theirs.

What is even worse is that Russia and China both vetoed a United Nations resolution to help Syrians in their time of need, because the Syrian regime gives those country money for their goods, including weapons. I entirely agree with Hillary Clinton that it is "despicable" of Russia and China to do this.

Our role as human beings should be to help those people most in need. Syria is the country in civil war with the least amount of help from anyone. We can change that; all we need to do is to stand up for what is right.
