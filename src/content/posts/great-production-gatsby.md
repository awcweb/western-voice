AWCTheatre will be performing The Great Gatsby, an iconic play based on American author F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel, adapted for the stage by Simon Levy.

"This is a play about lies, love and how it all connects," says Daniela Ayala, Arizona Western College Theatre/Biology Major and director of this student production.

This is Ayala's first time directing at AWC, although she directed several productions while a student at Kofa High School.

"What I'm trying to relay to the audience is that this is all a memory," explains Daniela, "a memory that Nick decided to tell everyone as a lesson."

Daniela has a love of musicals and hoped to direct one, but she was worried about the complexity of directing a musical. Instead she chose The Great Gatsby because it had many of the same components that she was after, such as great musical numbers and dancing.

"Better yet, it was set in the Jazz Age, the decade of partying and glamour!" Daniela exclaims. "I studied the book in high school and felt like this was a great choice to bring on to the AWC stage."

Under new leadership

Although this is an all-student production, the group has guidance when needed from Technical Director Michael Kennedy and from the new Professor of Theatre Ann Wilkinson.

"For this student production, my role is to advise, offer assistance and insure that deadlines are met," says Wilkinson.

Gatsby is the first production since Wilkinson came here from Central College in Pella, Iowa. She holds a B.A. in Theatre from Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., and was awarded an M.A. in Directing from Roosevelt University in Chicago.

The story takes place in West Egg, a fictional town on Long Island, N.Y., in the summer of 1922. The young and mysterious Jay Gatsby is infatuated by Daisy, a beautiful former debutant. Daisy, in turn, is married to her cheating husband Tom but is drawn to Gatsby.

The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man who moves to New York from Minnesota to learn about the bond business. Nick eventually is invited to one of the huge parties thrown by the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and becomes involved in the lives and the drama of the socialite scene that revolves around Gatsby and his mansion.

Who, when and where

The cast for the AWC production includes Andre Belous as Jay Gatsby, Sam Cundiff as Daisy Fay Buchanan, Edgar Figueroa as Nick Carraway, Rachel Barker as Jordan Baker, Gabriel Sanderson as Thomas "Tom" Buchanan and Tracey Edwards as Myrtle Wilson.

On September 3, cast members donned period costumes and performed scenes from the play at the 2014 Fine Arts Faculty Art Exhibit reception on the AWC campus.

The play will run for two weekends, October 10--12 and 17--19, in the AWC Theater. Show times on Friday and Saturday are 7:30 p.m. and on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Suggested donations are $10, five articles of clean, wearable clothing or five non-perishable food items.
