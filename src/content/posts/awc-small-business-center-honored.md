TEMPE, AZ - The Arizona Small Business Development Center Network (AZSBDC) recognized its best performers in service delivery and economic impact at its Network-wide meeting last week.

Arizona Western College SBDC was honored as the 2010 Center of Excellence for meeting or exceeding key goals during the past year. Arizona Western College SBDC Center Director Randy Nelson was named State Star, based on attaining the highest achievement in the combined areas of economic impact and client satisfaction in the state.

The AZSBDC measures economic impact in areas including job creation and retention, business starts, sales increases and capital formation.

Nelson joined the AZSBDC Network after a successful business career, bringing a wealth of small business and corporate sales and operational experience with him. He holds a Bachelor's Degree from Northern Arizona University and an MBA from Webster University in Yuma. Other Arizona Western College SBDC team members include Business Analysts Sandra Hernandez and Alan Pruitt.

"The Arizona Western SBDC turned in an all-around excellent performance under Randy's leadership," AZSBDC State Director Janice Washington said. "It is clear that the efforts of the SBDC team are having a significant positive impact on the Yuma area economy."

"Randy has consistently provided effective support for the creation and retention of businesses in the Yuma community," agrees Lynn LaBrie, Dean for Business and Workforce Development at Arizona Western College's Entrepreneurial Center. "He keeps abreast of the latest technology and social media strategies to help businesses remain competitive. We are proud of his accomplishments and of this statewide recognition."

Business Analyst Alex Cooper was honored for achieving the Highest Economic Impact (overall) in the Network. Cooper works with clients of the Microbusiness Advancement Center SBDC in Tucson.

Central Arizona College SBDC Center Director Jim Rhodes earned the Network's Highest Client Satisfaction award for earning high marks from his SBDC client base.

The AZSBDC also recognized individual team members who achieved certification and recertification as business analysts, or certification to facilitate Profit Mastery business resource training.

The AZSBDC Network includes 11 Centers and 12 satellite locations that serve small businesses across Arizona. Centers are located in Maricopa County, Flagstaff, Prescott, Casa Grande, Kingman, Payson, Show Low, Sierra Vista, Thatcher, Tucson and Yuma.

"We are a strong state network and I am very proud to recognize the accomplishments of the team," noted Washington.

SBDC programs are funded in part through a cooperative agreement with the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The innovative, statewide AZSBDC Network is hosted by the Maricopa County Community Colleges District and operated in partnership with nine other community college districts and one non-profit corporation.
