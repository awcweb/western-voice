In a small town filled with culture, there is only one place to go to enjoy it all -- 8th Street, otherwise known as Little Mexico.

Eighth Street is filled with delicious food and snacks that represent the Mexican culture. There are taco stands lined up by the mile, as well as two famous raspado shops -- Mr. Mango and Penguinos.

These two are back-to-back, both offering authentic Mexican candy and raspados, or shaved ice of all flavors. The two shops are highly recommended by locals, since they both offer outstanding service and delicious food.

Also, for those who crave a fresh taco alongside their raspado, there is a variety of choices to choose from. The most convenient choice, however, is the food truck known as Asadero Los Compadres. This is convenient location if you are coming out of either Mr. Mango or Penguios, since it is right next to them outside.

A fun fact about Asadero Los Compadres is that they not only serve delicious authentic Mexican food, but they also cater and bring life for birthday parties, weddings and even just a family gathering.

Numerous taco stands down 8th Street offer an authenticity that wouldn't be experienced anywhere else. Little Mexico is definitely a place worth visiting.
