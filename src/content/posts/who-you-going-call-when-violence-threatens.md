Though 1 out of 4 women are abused, many feel isolated and scared because they don't know where or how to find the help they need.

The Arizona Western College campus has its own champion in the form of the Violence Prevention Program (VPP). AWC graduate Jose Amparo, the program's enthusiastic and dedicated Violence Prevention Specialist, wants everyone to know what the program offers and that it is a safe place to go for help.

Amparo has strong credentials and a local perspective. He graduated from AWC in 2005 and then from Northern Arizona University - Yuma in 2010, where he is currently working on his master's in Community Counseling. He also has worked in the behavioral and mental-health field in Yuma and Wellton for four years.

At AWC, Amparo visits classes to talk about VPP services, and he goes to the resident halls with the Health group speaking about the prevention of STD's. His goal is to create awareness of what constitutes violence and how to prevent it. He hopes the information students receive here will carry on into their personal and work lives after they graduate.

Join the Club

According to Amparo, an important part of the VPP is the Peer Education Club, whose goal is to "help recognize and promote healthy relationships -- intimate, friends and family -- through community services, advocacy and education." The Club, which consists of both men and women, meets twice a week -- 2:00 p.m. Tuesdays and 3:00 p.m. Wednesdays.

The VPP is here to help victims and perpetrators of sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking. The Program wants to help all of those who are part of the AWC/NAU campus, including their home and work life outside of the campus.

Getting in touch

The Office of the Violence Prevention Program is located in the NW corner of the CTE building, just to the north of the Learning Resources building. Office hours are Monday-Thursday, from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and the phone number during those hours is 317-7108. For problems outside these hours, the contact is AWC Campus Police (314-9500), who in turn will contact VPP.

The VPP program is classified as a "not mandatory reporter," so its staff is not obligated to involve the police or report to other government agencies if there is a confidential concern. In order to retain this confidentiality after hours, those who contact the VPP through the Campus Police should simply state that they are not filing a report and only want to talk to someone.

A report also can be made online from the AWC website, where the "Incident Report Form" can be accessed and filled out via the Campus Life link located on the top menu.

The old saying is that prevention is the best medicine. Amparo states that everyone can help prevent problem situations on campus by always being aware of the surroundings, sticking to lighted walkways and walking with friends.

For online safety, in communicating with friends and faculty, students should use their TORO Mail, a secure and monitored site.

Whether for advice about preventing a problem or solving one, VPP is here to help.
