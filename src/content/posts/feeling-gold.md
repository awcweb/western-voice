Arizona Western College celebrated its 50th-year Homecoming weekend with the color Gold and with a variety of activities -- a parade, a crowning, and exciting sports contests.

Riding in Style

Seven groups participated in the annual Golf Cart Contest, from the Math Club to our Soccer teams, and the winner was the SOTE club. Their cart featured the Golden Ticket covered by candies, followed by characters dressed up as Umpalumpas who sang about how AWC is the perfect college. The winning cart was in charge of being this year's carriage for our Homecoming King and Queen, Logan Soakai and Araceli Acosta.

Logan, 18, came to AWC from Hawaii to continue his education and get enough transferable credits for a four-year university. Logan is currently involved in extracurricular activities here at AWC as president of the RHA club and as a proud member of the Polly club.

"I'm actually not sure how I got nominated, but it's flattering," said Logan.

Logan wore his crown tall and strong. However no king would be anything without his Queen. Araceli Acosta, elected Lady Matador of 2013-14, is currently enrolled in her last year at AWC and will be graduating this spring with an Associate's in Business. Our queen will be transferring to the Art Institute in Tucson next fall, perusing a degree in fashion design.

Araceli is proud of representing AWC and the Yuma community.

"Being a representative of such a prestigious college will give me the opportunity to serve as an example to others and become better acquainted with AWC programs, activities and community," said Araceli.

Celebrating with wins

Our Lady Matadors started the winning streak for our athletes this Homecoming weekend. The soccer team kept AWC athletics high in the rankings, beating South Mountain 9-0 on Saturday afternoon and grabbing a seat in playoffs.

Ending the week, Matador Football had an amazing win against New Mexico Military Institute, 47-27. The third quarter was led by Matador Tyler Rodgers, who ended the game 20 for 25 with 221 yards and two touchdown passes in the air, including 91 yards and three touchdowns on the ground.

The stands were filled with both local and out-of-state Matador supporters cheering throughout the game, "WE WANNA WE WANNA WE WANNA TOUCH DOWN!" The crowd went wild as time ran out, ending Homecoming week the way it should end -- with a win!
