"Bracelets of Hope" are among the gems, jewels, and stones currently being offered to the millions of visitors and snowbirds who enjoy this Sonoran desert town of Quartzsite, Arizona each winter season. Heather Caton, President of the World Genesis Foundation, designs and sells the bracelets to raise money for the Atlantykron Summer Academy for Youth in Romania. "We have had such wonderful support for the Bracelets of Hope," says Heather. "It is the small things that add up to big change in the world and we can all be a part of that change."

One hundred percent of the proceeds from "Bracelets of Hope" go directly to the World Genesis Foundation to help fund the annual "Atlantykron" summer program. Atlantykron will host over 300 youth. Professors and experts in a variety of fields such as science, physics, art, astronomy, and culture volunteer their time and expertise to join the organizers from the World Genesis Foundation to inspire and engage the students during the summer program in this unique educational experience.

Quartzsite, in far western Arizona, has been a rock hound's paradise since the 1960's. Located 20 miles east of the Colorado River on Interstate 10, Quartzsite is a mecca to well over a million visitors each year, according to desertusa.com. "Bracelets of Hope" can be purchased at AWC Quartzsite Learning Center, who continues to be a big supporter in the fundraising efforts.
