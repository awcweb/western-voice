Maia Cassidy, Art Major/ceramic student, has received a merit award for one of her three vases in the All AZ Clay Juried Exhibition. Kyrsten Pilger, President of the AWC League of Artists, also has a sculpture of a coyote in the exhibit.

The two Arizona Western College ceramic artists are currently exhibiting their work at the Shemer Art Center in Phoenix. The show runs from March 29 through April 25, 2012.

"It is thrilling to be playing in a world where there are so many infinite possibilities that have yet to be discovered," wrote Kyrsten on her placard.

The exhibition is a statewide show that was juried by Agnese Udinotti, renowned Scottsdale artist, who selected the work of ceramic artists from around the state, as well as the awards. 31 artists participated in the event to try for one of three categories: First Place Award won by Deborah Hodder from Phoenix; three received Merit Awards, including Cassidy; and one received the Emerging Artist Award.

Shemer Art Center is located at 5005 E. Camelback Road in Phoenix. Hours of Exhibit are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 3 p.m. with additional hours on Thursday from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. The center is closed Sunday and Monday.
