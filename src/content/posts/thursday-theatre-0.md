AWC foreign-independent film series continues

For as little as $2.50 with a student ID, or $5 without one, you can watch award-winning independent films at Thursday at the Theatre in Yuma's Historic Art Theatre on Main Street. The series, now in its 11th year, is brought to you by the Arizona Western College Foundation and sponsored by KAWC Colorado River Public Media, AWC-NAU Academic Library and the Yuma Art Center

The evening event begins at 7 p.m. on the first Thursday of each month -- with the exception of August, when it falls in the third week. The doors open at 6:30 p.m. so that viewers will have time to purchase $2 bags of popcorn and $2 sodas and find a good seat. Before the feature film, AWC Professor Michael Miller gives an introduction and any disclaimers, and an award-winning short film is shown.

After both films, interested viewers are welcome to stay and join Professor Miller's film class to discuss and critique the films.

AWC Foundation Thursdays at the Theatre: Aug 2016 -- Dec 2016

Aug 25, 2016 - Sea Fog

South Korea | 2014 | Drama- Thriller| Korean w/ English Subtitles | 111 min| Club Date: 12/1/2015

Synopsis Kang, a long time captain of the Junjin, is disheartened to learn that his ship has been sold by its owner, leaving Kang's entire crew in danger of losing their livelihood. Swallowing his pride, Kang pays a visit to Yeo, a human trafficking broker, and decides to take on the dangerous job of smuggling illegal migrants into South Korea. When the Junjin arrives at the pickup point, a violent storm forces the boat to stall in the open waters, inevitably pitting Kang's crew against the migrants. As tension and unrest spread throughout the Junjin, a dense sea fog envelops the boat, and tragedy unfolds in the mysterious depths of the fog...

Sept 1, 2016 - Mad Tiger

United States and Japan | 2015 | Documentary-Music| English | 82 min| Club Date: 1/1/2016

"Fantastic portrait of a band and its leader that works on so many different levels. What I love about the film is that what starts out with a look at a band changes into a look at what it takes to be in a band and how the relationships outside of the band are forced to change because of the dynamics of the band." -- Steve Kopian, Unseen Films

Synopsis MAD TIGER follows bandmates Yellow (Kengo Hioki) and Red (Kotaro Tsukada), who have been best friends and business partners for fifteen years as the primary creative forces behind Peelander-Z. Based in New York City and described as a "Japanese Action Comic Punk Band," Peelander-Z combines performance-art and audience participation in their shows, which push the boundaries of madcap acrobatic stage antics. As part of the band, each member must adopt a different, anime-like "Crayola rock" persona and fully embrace this assigned identity in every aspect of life. Seeking his own personal fulfillment, Red announces that he will do one final tour with Peelander-Z before quitting the band. In stark contrast to his character's super-positive facade, Yellow tries his best to keep it together, while dealing with emotions of shock, betrayal and abandonment. Channeling universal stories of friendship and pursuit of happiness, MAD TIGER builds to an unexpectedly moving crescendo, appropriately befitting of Peelander-Z's cacophonous melody-making.

Oct 6, 2016 - Schneider vs. Bax

Netherlands | 2015 | Drama| Dutch with English subtitles | 96 min| Club Date: 8/1/2016

"...the more absurd the circumstances, the more entertaining the movie gets."-- Peter Debruge, Variety

Synopsis Schneider, a hitman, gets a call from Mertens on the morning of his birthday. He has a last-minute assignment for Schneider who refuses the request because it is his birthday. Mertens insists that it is an important matter. When they meet in Mertens' office, Schneider is told that the target is Ramon Bax, a writer. He lives alone in a secluded place. "It's an easy job. With a little luck you're back home before noon." Schneider accepts the assignment. What was promised to be a simple hit turns out to be more than expected.

Nov 3, 2016 - My Love, Don't Cross That River

South Korea | 2014 | Documentary-Romance| Korean w/ English subtitles | 86 min| Club Date: 9/1/2016

"Ã–if, by its ending, it hasn't moved you to your core, you have an invulnerable heart." -- Andrew Blackie, Film Ink Australia

Synopsis 100-year old Lovebirds" Byong-man Jo and Gye-Yeul Kang have been inseparable companions for the past 76 years. Living in their small home by the river, they wear traditional Korean clothes, go shopping at the local market, have picnics with neighbors, and enjoy dance parties. Every night they go to sleep holding each other's hands. Observing this fragile couple for 15 months, director Moyoung Jin acts as a fly-on-the-wall, capturing their twilight days with tender moments that reveal simple acts of affection - from a good-natured leaf fight to a gentle caress of the cheek. A blockbuster in its native Korea, where it would go on to become the country's biggest independent film of all time, MY LOVE, DON'T CROSS THAT RIVER presents an unforgettable story of true love that transcends both generations and cultures.

Dec 1, 2016 - Men Go To Battle

USA | 2015 | Drama| English | 98 min| Club Date: 10/1/2016

"An instant-classic Western..." -- Richard Brody, The New Yorker

Synopsis Most Americans predict that the Civil War will end by Christmas, but Henry (Tim Morton) and Francis Mellon (David Maloney) couldn't care less. Bracing for another winter on their struggling farm in rural Kentucky, the brothers have become suffocatingly close. Francis' practical jokes become more and more aggressive until the night he accidentally injures Henry in a drunken fight. After humiliating himself in front of a daughter (Rachel Korine) of the town's preeminent family, Henry disappears in the night. Months later, Francis learns that Henry has joined the Union army, and the two are left to find out separately what the approaching war will bring.
