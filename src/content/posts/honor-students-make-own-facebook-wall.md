Most college students spend hours every day in front of a computer screen or on their cell phone checking out the latest statuses and pictures on Facebook. AWC Honor students, however, made their own non-electronic Facebook.

Now in LR 86, Facebook postings can be found on the very walls that hold the Honors Center together. This idea belongs to Honors Director Ted Martinez, who wanted to give Honor students a way to connect since everyone has different schedules.

One wall contains room for students to leave "status updates," and comments just as they would on regular Facebook walls.

They can also print a picture, write a caption and post it on another wall dedicated to pictures of Honor students. Other students can comment on the pictures as well

Honors Senior Secretary Rachel Roman has taken notice to the responses students have been giving after viewing the new addition to the Honors Center. She says that the Facebook influence is creating excitement, increasing traffic in the Honors Center, and helps students meet other Honors students they don't have class with.

"Everyone was anxious and excited to put something up," Roman said. "They can get to know other Honor students and feel more comfortable once they meet them in person."

Honors student Zaynab Hourani agrees with Roman and enjoys checking out the personalization on the Facebook walls when she comes into the Honors Center. She also likes the way it brings Honors students together.

"It really helps in getting to know who everyone is," Hourani said.

This new approach to Facebook has helped Honor students become more interactive and gain closer connections with one another without a computer or phone screen in front of them.

Anyone is welcome to check out the Facebook walls Monday through Thursday in the Honors Center. To get more information on the Honors Program, you can contact Martinez at Ted.Martinez@azwestern.edu.
