Many people have no idea that Yuma has such talented musicians performing classical music and jazz. The Brass Ensemble at Arizona Western College is made up of current and former AWC faculty, students, local band directors and community members. They performed March 20 at the band shell behind the Engineering Bldg. The audience came with their lawn chairs and lunch bags with drinks and snacks to hear them perform.

The Ensemble opened with the "Slavic March," which definitely grabbed everyone's attention. Before performing the next tune, the conductor, Susan Salminen, spoke briefly -- and humorously -- about the group.

Their instruments included the trumpet, the tuba, euphonium and brass trombone, among others. The various numbers featured the instruments in various limited combinations, and at the very end the whole group gathered for the grand finale, a fun tune titled "Another Cat: Kracken," which stirred the crowd with its catchy and pleasing melody.

Overall, the concert was a superb musical, with a mixture of brassy and beautiful tunes. Everything was remarkably well played, but the crowd's favorite was perhaps "Fly Me to the Moon" by the Yuma Brass Quintet.

Anyone who isn't familiar with the AWC Brass group should make it a point to attend one of their free concerts throughout the year.
