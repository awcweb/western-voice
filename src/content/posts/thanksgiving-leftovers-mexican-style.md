With Thanksgiving right around the corner, the top priority on everyone's mind is gathering around a huge feast with loved ones. Of course, Thanksgiving is not complete without a big turkey dinner, and what is a Thanksgiving weekend without stuffing ourselves with leftovers?

Sure, there is always the typical turkey sandwich for lunch. But, with the addition of a few more simple ingredients, that leftover turkey can be turned into another family dinner -- Mexican-style Turkey Enchiladas!

Ingredients:

4 Cups of shredded turkey

1-2 Large cans of green enchilada sauce

24 Corn tortillas

2 Cups of shredded cheddar and Monterey cheese blend (amount may vary)

2 Roma tomatoes

a quarter Yellow or brown onion

1 Jalape√ío pepper

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Dice tomatoes, onion and jalapeno.

In a pan, heat about 2 tsp. vegetable oil and sautethe diced tomatoes, onion and jalapeno.

In a bowl, mix vegetables with shredded turkey.

In a small pan, heat enough vegetable oil to coat the corn tortillas lightly just until they are soft. (Note: Corn tortillas may be microwaved on high for about 30 seconds.)

On a 13"x9" dish pour a light layer of green enchilada sauce on the bottom.

Add shredded turkey mixture on the center of the tortilla and once rolled place in the dish. Repeat this step until all the enchiladas have been rolled and placed side by side in the dish.

Sprinkle desired amount of cheese over the rolled enchiladas and pour enough green enchilada sauce on top to coat evenly. (More cheese may be added on top of the sauce.)

Bake for 20 min. in the oven or until cheese is thoroughly melted.

10. Let the turkey enchiladas cool for 10 min., and enjoy!

This recipe is good for 6 servings with a preparation time of about 25 minutes and a bake time of about 20 minutes -- or 45 minutes total.

These Turkey Enchiladas are a great way to use that delicious leftover turkey for another family dinner. Serve them with a side of refried beans and rice, and top it with some sour cream for a finishing touch that your loved ones are sure to enjoy!
