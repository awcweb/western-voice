Whether allergies are more prominent today or whether families are just more able to detect them due to new technologies, the number or students with allergies is reaching all-time highs. In any case, the enlightened food-service staff at Arizona Western College is prepared to take everyone's order.

AWC English major Amy Abrian has a severe reaction to peanuts and faces the dangers of being exposed to her allergy every day. However, Abrian can rest assured that when she orders from the cafeteria, as long as the request is made, her order will be peanut free.

According to "An Intense Look at Food," a recent study by students at the University of Cambridge, the U.S. has seen a sky-high rise in the number of students with food allergies -- some being mere intolerances and some being very severe and even life threatening. Many wonder whether this is because of the constant alteration of food or whether the population is simply much more aware of its allergies.

The Cambridge study also showed that during the past 60 years farmers have been making dramatic genetic modifications to wheat and grains, which are bred with a higher gluten content, leading to greater crop yield.

Students need to be educated about the foods they put into their bodies and aware that there are alternatives and substitutions.

"If someone were to come to us and say they have specific allergies, we would do everything in our power to make sure that it is completely safe for them to eat," says Jenni, a server at the AWC Eatery.

"Not all colleges can accommodate students like me," says Abrian. "I feel really lucky to be in a place and a community that takes pride in making sure everyone is taken care of and well fed."
