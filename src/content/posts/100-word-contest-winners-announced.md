First Place Student: "Siblings"

By Wayne McDonald

"Pickles! Nobody puts pickles on a turkey sandwich, you stupid cow. Go make me another one! No pickles this time!"

Mona's one good eye√ñdark and smoky, fixed her brother with a venomous stare.

"Watch your mouth little boy. You remember the last time you smarted off to me?"

"Yeah, but you caught me off guard. It won't happen again, Cyclops."

The ketchup bottle landed perfectly in the center of Clive's skull with a muffled "crack."

His eyes rolled up as he slumped into the potato salad.

Mona exhaled.

"Dad always said I had the reflexes of a Yankee shortstop."

Second Place Student: "The Chase"

By Jacquelyn Medina

Someone was behind me, closer than my shadow. Every corner I turned, every door I went through, it was following close behind. I glanced back. There he was! Holding an unknown object. A box. He ran back towards the door and I followed. I was quick. Cornered him. I snatched my shadow friend's box. Inside, a sketch of a child, my father's copy of Utopia, and a necklace from an old lover. I must have looked puzzled because after a few seconds, he announced, "Surely, you recognize me child? I am your past! Now, for goodness sake, stop chasing me!"

First Place Faculty/Staff: "Warning: The Folies Bergere is a Portal"

By Ed Schubert

Somewhere in space-time, a universe exists that is an exact parallel of our own: where earth is the third planet from the sun, where Barack Obama is President of the United States, where cars float down Highway 95, and where a parallel you is reading this identical story.

The parallel world betrays only the smallest differences from our own, such as this:

In Manet's Bar at the Folies Bergere, the barmaid has oranges in her bowl, not pears.

If you fear you've stumbled into the parallel world, visit the Folies Bergere.

You may be waiting for you there.

Second Place Faculty/Staff: "The White Patent Leather Alligator"

By Nancy Gilkey

We say the alligator grinning by the couch in the living room. "He's friendly," I said.

"He's special," Pam said, as we marveled at his white skin.

"It's shiny, like patent leather." His tail slithered; his eyes locked on mine. Pam tossed a pillow, he snapped, and we fled.

"Don't look back!" she warned.

"But he's so vulnerable." I returned to check on him and felt the hair rise on the back of my neck. I slammed the door and ran to Pam.

"You can never pet an alligator," she said. And the truth sank like teeth into my heart.
