Ten painful hours on a bus ride to Santa Fe, N.M. -- but these students never could have imagined the experiences they were about to have.

On a three-day field trip last month, a group from Arizona Western College and met CAMP students from other institutions around the Southwest and participated in various workshops intended to teach what it takes to be a community leader.

The workshops, presented by professors at colleges from around the region, ranged from Woman's Leadership to Focus-Based Leadership to poetry writing regarding justice within communities. At one point, Dr. Waded Cruzado, President of Montana State University, spoke to the students about the importance of working towards their goals and about being leaders no matter what the challenges.

CAMP (College Assistance Migrant Program) helps students, specifically those who are migrants or who are dependent on seasonal farm work, to study during their first year in college. The program has been present on campus for four years teaching such skills as leadership.

CAMP member Cynthia Camarillo, who went to the conference last year, is now an active member in groups such as RHA (Resident Hall Association) and the Theater Club and is also a front desk worker in the residence halls and a CAMP mentor.

"I loved it," said Cynthia about her experience in the conference. "It motivated me to get out of my comfort zone."

Many other students who have gone through the CAMP program have benefitted for their future by getting involved around campus. Some of them have ended up as an RA (Resident Assistant), others have become AWC employees and still others make decisions for as active members of the Student Government Association.

Biomedical Sciences major Edgar Villavicencio explains how the conference inspired him to be a leader.

"The workshops opened my eyes of the potential that I have in order to become a leader," said Villavicencio. "Now I'm in charge of the upcoming AWC CAMPSA blood drive." No matter what path the CAMP students take after their first year of college, the skills gained in the workshops will always follow them. If nothing else, the experience of meeting people from different states but from similar backgrounds has helped them realize how small the world can be.
