People who were victims of domestic violence before the pandemic might have been able to find another place to go, but now the probabilities of domestic abuse are increasing. By no fault of their own, some people, instead of having a good time relaxing with their love ones, are having a horrible time at home. The place that should be full of peace and love is full violence.

Spending too much time locked in a house tends to cause certain problems. Even people with no history of mental problems can get to a point where they can’t hold on anymore. Stress, frustration and other emotions combine to make small problems into huge ones.

If you fit this description, don’t take it out on the people at home or on other people. Try to find a place where you can be alone in your house to calm down yourself so that you don’t harm the ones who love you. Seek help from those around you if you feel that something is wrong.

If you don’t have anyone at home with whom you can release those tensions, don’t worry, there is always someone who cares about you, who will be there for you when you need them. And, if you don’t have someone to support you at home, contact someone on the outside.

Some people don’t know how to handle especially stressful situations and direct that stress at others, causing domestic problems and even harming their own families. In many cases, they need professional help.

Further complicating the situation, it is harder at the moment to receive help from others due to the risk of getting infected from the Coronavirus. People cannot be taken to sheltered places because they might also be at risk there. In some cases, they may have to wait until all this end to get the help they need.

The major focus of society right now is to stop the spread of the virus. This pushes aside the problems of people who are in need in other ways.

Domestic violence has always existed, but these days cases are increasing. Some people are stuck at home in dangerous situations. Let’s let these people know that they are not alone, that everything is going to be all right, that there are good people who will help them no matter what.
