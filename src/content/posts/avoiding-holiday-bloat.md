Christmas and the New Year are just around the corner which means it is time for you to make your very special holiday goodies. One of the things that everyone has in common during the holidays is to eat, eat, EAT!

Maybe this year it is your turn to bake up the desserts to bring to the family gathering. You know they’re going to be good, but you’re afraid to scarf down a few cookies because you don’t want to gain that extra holiday weight. Not to worry, there are other options for enjoying those same holiday favorites without having to sacrifice your craving for sweets, options that you can actually purchase at your local grocers instead of baking up a storm in your house.

Everyone is a big fan of cookies and nobody can eat just one. Did you know that your local food market sells reduced-fat chocolate chip cookies? According to the FDA’s “Fat Free vs. Regular Calorie Comparison” chart, three regular chocolate chip cookies (30 g.) consist of 142 calories, and the same number of reduced-fat chocolate chip cookies have only 118 calories. If you like to have that slice of pie “a la mode” with caramel topping, try buying low-fat ice cream. A half cup of regular vanilla ice cream has 133 calories, while low-fat has only 111. Even though caramel topping is known to be very high in sugar, low-fat and regular actually contain the same number of calories. (Still, reduced fat would be a better choice.)

Also, try serving a nice spread of fresh fruit instead of so many pastries. Yes, a slice of melon might not sound as good as a cherry strudel, but it’s much better for you. Try having fun with it by cutting up the fruit into fun shapes. This may get the young ones into eating it as well.

In addition to healthy eating, exercise plays an important role in keeping off that holiday belly. Think of it as a special holiday workout. Perhaps consider going outside and putting up a few more Christmas decorations or maybe even help the neighbors out with theirs. Another good way to have a bit of a workout is to get creative and make decorations that require some heavier lifting, like a wooden Nativity set.

Bottom line, do some sort of physical activity after eating a holiday meal. Lounging around after stuffing yourself with turkey, mashed potatoes and rolls may not be the smartest thing to do. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to jog five miles. Cleaning house or strolling around the block will help get your metabolism going, so your food will digest faster and not turn into so much fat.

For that matter, why not make it a point to schedule a family walk around the neighborhood to check out all the outdoor holiday decorations?
