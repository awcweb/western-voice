A new construction-improvement project is underway at AWC's Parker Learning Center on the corner of Geronimo and 11th streets, to include asphalt-paved parking around the complex, a new concrete stairs at the front entrance and a new traffic-flow pattern for the existing two parking lots. No contractors from the La Paz County area submitted a construction bids for the project, and the contract was awarded to CEMEX of Yuma. The upgrade is scheduled for completion before the beginning of the Spring 2014 semester.

"We have an excellent learning environment inside our AWC Parker complex," says Rich Tozer, interim associate dean of AWC La Paz Services, adding, "This project will improve student safety and provide a better entrance to our college."
