The AWC Gallery has been exceptionally active this semester, beginning with the January exhibit by painter Kristin Schauk.

Next was an exhibit by AWC Associate Professor of Art Stacy Blackmer, who also gave a dynamic presentation on her work to a rapt audience of students, staff and assorted art lovers from the community.

The exhibit that went up in March features AWC students in the Graphic Arts program. And this month an exhibit goes up featuring graduating AWC students in the visual arts.

Finally, a new mural was painted outside the Gallery by several talented students in the Program. A visit to the Gallery -- or even just a quick pass by the building -- is guaranteed to liven up the bleakest or most stressful day.

Paintings: "Guinevere", "From the Pages of History" and Patti Smith" by Stacy Blackmer
