After 50 years, one of the original buildings on the Arizona Western College campus is suddenly brand new again.

A supportive audience gathered On Oct. 15 for the grand opening celebration of Phase I of the newly renovated Engineering Technology Building. The project is the result of a competitive grant won by AWC in collaboration with the University of Arizona to provide a Bachelor's degree in Engineering on the Yuma campus.

Event speakers included Avinash Tiwari, president of the AWC/UA Engineering Club; Savanna Silva, a recent UA/AWC graduate; Dr. Larry Head, head of the UofA Systems Engineering & Engineering Management Department; Colonel Reed Young, commander of Yuma Proving Grounds; and AWC President Dr. Glenn Mayle. The event was hosted by Dr. James Jones, director of the collaborative AWC/US STEM -- Futures Grant.

After the ceremony, participant could take a self-guided tour of the facility, which included an exhibit hall, demonstrations of solar technology and sketches of future construction.

Phase 1 of the grant included 13 new faculty/staff offices, a conference room, a display gallery, 2 ITN classrooms (one of which is also a lab), several equipment storage areas and a student activities area featuring floor-to-ceiling see-through walls that allow students to collaborate by writing on the flexible glass material.

Upon completion, the project will be a state-of-the-art educational facility with nearly 18,000 square feet of floor space. Phase 2 will include additional classrooms, another ITN room and a student coordination & innovation room. The final phase actually will be new construction on the east side of the existing building, with two high-bay labs and an outdoor testing area.

AWC just got better -- again.
