In 2010 Arizona Western College had the vision to bring a program that could serve our migrant or seasonal farmworker population. The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) is a unique federally-funded educational support and scholarship program that helps, nationwide, more than 2,000 students annually from migrant and seasonal farm working backgrounds to reach and succeed in college.

The CAMP program at AWC is designed to serve 40 first-year college students per year. Through rigorous academic services, personal guidance, financial assistance and a residential program, CAMP helps students transition from high school to college and develop the skills necessary to succeed and transfer to any university and complete their Bachelor degree.

In 2015 the CAMP was refunded at AWC for another 5 years.
