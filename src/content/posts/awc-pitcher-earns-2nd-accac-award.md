AWC baseball pitcher, Tim Keller is the first to earn an ACCAC award two weeks in a row. He is also the first player in over a decade to throw a no-hitter

Keller stated, “It is unimaginable, but yet a huge accomplishment.” Keller is third in conference strike- outs, having 91 k’s in 78 innings.

“I have always been good with my strike-outs,” Keller said, smiling.

Being a freshman, he is excited and expects to continue playing well and wanting to take on more wins.

Keller leads the team in wins and is tenth in conference in that category. His ERA is 2.31, which is the top ten in ACCAC Division.
