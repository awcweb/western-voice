Arizona Western College’s Math Department recently announced the opening of the new Math Learning Complex on Monday, April 12th.

AWC was chosen to receive 3.5 million dollars from the College Cost Reduction and Access (CCRAA) Grant in October of 2008 after a review of the Math program by faculty and staff members. They concluded AWC should revise the math curriculum and teaching strategies, enhance the tutoring services for students, strengthen student advising with new facilities/technologies which will streamline articulation/transfer models with Northern Arizona University, University of Arizona and Arizona State University. This will benefit transfer students interested in pursuing science, engineering, technology or math (STEM) careers.

The classrooms within the new Math Center feature interactive whiteboards, computers built into the student desks and clickers that give real-time assessment feedback. Anne Gallagher, Mathematics Professor and Math Learning Specialist said, “This facility will bring technology into the math classrooms that will facilitate a more interactive learning experience.”

The Math Center is open to all AWC students who would like to receive free tutoring in math or science, attend weekly SI workshops or enjoy a quiet place to study either in one of the private, window cubicles or in the large room available. Tutoring is available on a walk-in basis only with individual or small group assistance. There are currently 17 tutors available to cover 60 hours a week that the center is open, which means they get pretty busy, especially in the afternoons. Other learning tools are available also, i.e. textbooks, algebra tiles, shortcuts to My Math Lab and other computer programs. Laptops can also be signed out if you need them for school assignments.

Karina Jaramillo, Technology Assistant in the Math Center, said the transition “is going smooth and we’re really happy. There have been a few glitches, but we’re gradually getting them worked out.”

The hours of the new Math Center are: Monday-Thursday 8am-8pm; Friday 10am-3pm and Sunday noon- 8pm. The math center phone number is: 928-317-6451. For more information call Anne Gallagher at 344-7587 or Cheryl Johnston at 344-7715.
