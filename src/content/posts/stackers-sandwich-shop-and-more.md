Stacking up to the demands of hungry college students, owners Terry and Theresa Gibbs have opened up a new sandwich shop just across 24th Street from the main entrance of Arizona Western College.

The new restaurant, Stackers, is a combination sandwich shop and Chili Express -- Mexican food prepared New Mexico style. Located at 7875 E. 24th St. in the Tamarack Shopping Center, Stackers offers a variety of quick and affordable menu items like sandwiches, salads, burritos, hot dogs, burgers and Frito pies.

The restaurant is open daily from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., and one of its most popular items, the made-to-order breakfast burrito, is available all day. Orders also can be called in at 928-366-1181, and take-out menus are available at the register.

The sandwiches are another favorite and, at the price of $5.50, well worth it. Each six-inch sub is made with more than a quarter pound of meat, choice of cheese, and a variety of vegetables. Foot-long sandwiches are just $7.50 and feature four kinds of meat. For a hot dish with that "comfort food" feel, the melted-cheese-and-chili Frito Pie is just $2.50; and a couple of fresh-baked cookies tops off the meal.

Recognizing the lack of a grocery store nearby, Stackers will also stock juices, milk, energy drinks and other staples that a college student may need in between trips to town.

The Gibbses want to be accommodating, and they invite their customers to let them know what they'd like to see for sale in the cold case.

Students are welcome to bring their books and settle into one of the many tables set up for dining and wireless internet. Or, if studying isn't on the agenda, there are two televisions for watching favorite shows or an athletic event.

Stacker is a perfect place to relax and eat all for an affordable price and the convenience of being just a few steps from campus.
