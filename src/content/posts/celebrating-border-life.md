From his office on the Arizona Western College campus, Ken Kuntzelman has a commanding view of the picturesque mountains that surround Yuma Valley. Within these mountain walls is a unique community, highlighted by the international border that cuts through its heart.

Kuntzelman, director of International Programs at AWC, has more insight than most when it comes to the significance this border has for the people who call this area home. That's because he, along with the San Luis Corporation for the Arts & Humanities, has been instrumental in bringing Barrier to Bridge, a celebration of the Yuma area's border culture, to the AWC campus.

"The whole idea is to celebrate and bring an appreciation for the unique nature of this particular regional community," explains Kuntzelman. With a large array of art shows, a film festival, and countless cultural presentations being held Feb. 11 -- 18, Barrier to Bridge (B2B) appears poised to accomplish that vision.

The city of San Luis will be hosting a variety of art shows, presentations and music, some of which feature local students. Also featured is a film festival comprised entirely of local talent. All events are free to the public.

When planning B2B, the organizers wanted to cap off the festivities with an academic conference, dubbed the Barrier to Bridge Symposium, to be held Feb. 17 on the AWC Campus. Tickets to the event are $59.

Crowded into this full day of events, are numerous art, music and educational presentations. Nancy Blitz, director of the AWC Center for Teaching Effectiveness, will team up with Olivia Zepeda, associate superintendent of the Gadsden school district, to discuss the challenges and opportunities of education in border communities.

Another of the main speakers will be former Arizona State Senator, Amanda Aguirre, who will talk about access to health care and other health care issues concerning the border region.

Stella Pope Duarte, distinguished author of many books on the subject of border life, will speak about immigration and its impact on the region and America as a whole.

The keynote speaker is Mary Ellen Colon, founder of The Culture Link and a consultant in the field of intercultural communication. Colon will address the issues of cross-cultural communication and new ways to bridge cultures and understand cultural differences.

Capping off the symposium will be a panel discussion featuring various community leaders from the area. This diverse panel will discuss everyday life in border communities and the challenges they face in today's rapidly changing society.

AWC is also host to a photography exhibit, on loan from the U.S.-Mexico Border Philanthropy Partnership, which focuses on border life. The exhibit runs through the month of February in the AWC Art Gallery.

Celebrating the history, art and culture of the region is a central theme for B2B, but there is another focal point as well. The celebration also is intended to change negative attitudes and perceptions associated with the border that maintain a connotation.

"Instead of looking at the border as a barrier, let's look at it as a bridge -- a creative flow of ideas, culture, art and commerce that makes this border a positive thing," implores Kuntzelman.
