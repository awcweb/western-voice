Angelina Sosa, Songbird

Mobility is such an integral part of being human. Everyday people wake up, sit up and get out of bed ready to take on the day. It is easy to forget, though, how much work the body does to allow everyday movement.

However, some people like Angelina Sosa (affectionately known as Songbird-61) can never forget such things. She has been wheelchair-bound her whole life, a victim of cerebral palsy, and her life has been shaped by that limitation.

“I want the campus community to know that I have a concern, which is my wheelchair. Without it I am not able to do anything,” Sosa said. “The doctor wants me to go out. I can’t, though, because I have to worry about charging. I can’t even go to Wal-Mart because there is nowhere to plug into.”

Like many people these days, she lives from outlet to outlet. Unlike most people, though, it is so that she can move, not so that she can be immersed in social media. Sosa constantly has to charge her wheelchair so that she can get from one place to the next. What many do effortlessly takes planning and worrying for her, lest she get stranded with no charge and no way to move.

“I’m having problems getting the wheelchair replaced or fixed,” Sosa said. “I put brand new batteries in over the summer, which cost over $300, and it didn’t fix anything. The chair was donated, so there is no warranty, and I need a new prescription for my chair. I’m worried that I won’t be able to start a new semester or even finish this one.”

Even with her constant worries she continues to go to school.

“People ask me why I am going to school. Well, I promised my mother that I would try to go to university if I could. She never finished school; she only got to the 5th or 6th grade. I also wanted to show younger people and older people that school is important. Some people don’t realize it until they are older.

“I don’t do anything without having a reason; I’ve been like this since I was small,” she added. “When I set out to do something, I do it. I don’t just sit and talk about it. I’m stubborn, opinionated, outgoing and motivated.”

Sosa does not want her physical limitations to stop her from achieving all she can and getting the most out of life. While her body may need assistance, her spirit does not. However, spirit alone can’t keep her alive; it needs help from a good environment and the motivation to carry on. AWC gives her the environment she needs to stay out in the world.

“My motivation comes from what my parents instilled in me, and the need to stay busy to stay alive,” she said.

“The environment I am living in is not good for me; it could kill me. My health started deteriorating when I went to Palm View. My immune system is so low and I can catch anything. That’s why it is so important for me to get away from sick people. I like meeting people, younger people who are open-minded like I am. I like being outdoors, breathing clean air and talking to people.”

Sosa is young, if not in body then in heart and spirit. She writes poetry and music, and she loves to sing, which is how she got the nickname “Songbird.” Although singing is her favorite pastime, school remains one of the most important activities in her life. In fact, she believes it may be the source of her ongoing life.

“I am going to school because I want to stay busy. I have a terminal illness, and the doctor doesn’t want me to lie in bed and just wait to die,” said Sosa. “I want to set an example for students here as well as the residents there [at Palm View Retirement Home]. I feel like most of them give up. I’m not one to give up.”

Sosa remains motivated, but it may be for naught if she can’t find a way to remain mobile. If she doesn’t get a chair or repair soon, she will no longer be able to go to school, possibly the only thing keeping her alive. Hopefully, a lack of mobility will not be the end of this woman’s dreams.
