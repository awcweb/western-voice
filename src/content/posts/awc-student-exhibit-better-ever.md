Art is one of the most profound methods of expressing oneself, and students exhibiting their work at the Art Gallery at Arizona Western College reflect that passion. With a plethora of distinctive drawings and sculptures, both literal and abstract, this exhibit had something for everyone.

Elizabeth k. Vargas exhibited a composite drawing and a model drawing. In the composite drawing, Brief Nights Summary, she combines depictions of people suffering from the plague in medieval times with contemporary symbols of alcoholism. Vargas does have a personal story attached to the painting of people being consumed by the temptations of night life; she would describe her work as abstract and would like viewers to create their own story and interpretation.

As she demonstrates in her model drawing, Portrait in the Works, her intention is not merely to draw a model in a pose but also to bring a human into an abstract painting.

Vargas will be taking over as curator of the Campus Gallery next semester. When asked about her goal as an artist, she said, "I want to be a curator at a museum one day."

Mady Rodriguez Marshal is another of the artists displaying multiple pieces at the exhibit, including a painting of a Native American Woman with paint on her face. In redrawing that painting, Marshal wants to promote her husband's Native American culture.

Marshal's black sculpture, Nightmare Seduction, depicts a man embracing himself with tentacles. Marshal wants to demonstrate how dark the human soul can be, and how people are restrained to extremes. With an almost relaxed atmosphere, the figure's embrace by the tentacles, representing sexuality, is meant to portray acceptance for who we really are.

What does Martha want to do with her skills? "I want to teach art one day."

Professors Angel Luna and George Tomkins chose the ceramics displayed in this exhibit, while the current Gallery director, Professor Bill Blomquist, chose the remaining pieces.

Anyone with a little time to devote to high culture could find something for all tastes in this exhibit -- drawings, sketches and portraits hanging from the walls and sculptures standing erect in the middle of the space. It was altogether a jolly good show.
