For the past seven years and counting, the General Education Curriculum Committee (GECC) has organized the Student Showcase, an event where students at Arizona Western College, Northern Arizona University-Yuma and the University of Arizona in Yuma can show off their talents or their knowledge in a variety of different forms.

"During the event, Showcase participants share poster presentations; vocal, musical, and dramatic performances; poetry recitations; multimedia graphic arts projects; welding projects; traditional conference-style papers; fine arts projects; and much, much more," says Ellen Riek, AWC Professor of English and GECC Chair.

This year more than a hundred students are expected to participate in the Showcase on a broad range of topics. Students are encouraged to attend the event to learn from the work that other students have completed or maybe to get exposure to an academic field that they hadn't considered before.

"I look forward to these types of events," says AWC student Andrea Robles. "I'll see something that it is interesting to me, and then I'll enroll in the class or look into the club."

Unlike the previous years, GECC was able to secure a donation from Gowan Company, which will provide five $1000 scholarships to participants who choose to apply. Riek says that the GECC hopes to continue offering these Showcase scholarships in future years.

This event is scheduled for Wednesday, April 29, and will last from 3-5 p.m. It will take place in the Schoening Conference Center located at the south end of the 3C building. For more information regarding this event, contact Ellen Riek at Ellen.Riek@azwestern.edu.
