Arizona Western College is hosting its third annual Majors for Matadors Fair on November 5. This is an excellent opportunity to make sure that your educational choices will lead you to a career that will be satisfying in the years ahead.

Have you been wondering if the major you picked is the right one for you? Do you have second thoughts about your future career path? Has it come to your attention that you need more facts about your major and about what the opportunities for employment are? Perhaps you have taken a class that you found an unexpected interest in and are thinking about changing your major.

AWC's Majors Fair is the opportunity to ask questions of faculty and students in the different majors. School representatives from many of the majors offered at AWC will be on hand to answer questions and offer guidance. There will also be advisors from Financial Aid, Career and Academic Services, Enrollment and the Foundation.

Mel Parker, a career development coordinator in AWC's Career Services, advises that students take advantage of this annual opportunity. He suggests that they prepare for the Majors Fair by seriously examining their educational focus and developing a list of questions to ask the professors in their current field or the field they are considering. This is an excellent opportunity to examine options, make changes, select classes to focus a career and to see the potential for a future career path.

Majors for Matadors is being held in the 3C building in the Schoening Center. All current AWC students, students transferring to Northern Arizona University, the University of Arizona and Arizona State University and future students of AWC are invited to this interactive event.

So put November 5 on your calendar. Come prepared to verify whether your academic path is exactly what you anticipated when you first declared your major. Ensure your future success by taking advantage of this once-a-year opportunity.
