I was inspired by a show I love on Food Network called 40$ a Day, hosted by Rachel Ray. In each episode Ray can spend no more than $40 for food on a one-day trip. I decided to invite my friend Aaron and choose three local restaurants from Yuma and try one thing on the menu from each place and see if I can do it with $20.

Our first stop was Da Boyz, an Italian restaurant on Main Street with a romantic, date-night vibe. We wanted to save room for all three restaurants, so we decide to split a turkey and provolone sandwich toasted. I thought maybe it would be a normal sandwich similar to Subway, but was I wrong. Even though Aaron and I split the sandwich, I was getting full with half of my half! The turkey was freshly sliced at the restaurant, the cheese was melted to perfection and the Italian dressing that it comes with was homemade and delicious. All of this piece of heaven cost only $8.99 and it was worth every penny. In all honesty, this place was my favorite from the three places we ate that day.

After that amazing meal, Aaron and I went right across the street to Lute's Casino, with its unique atmosphere. The walls are filled from top to bottom, corner to corner, with posters, signs and memorabilia. There were pool tables all along the back of the place and a bar top in the front. After five minutes of just staring at the walls, we finally decide to order a cheeseburger and fries. The fries were your average burger joint fries, but the burger was delicious and perfectly cooked. I was more than happy with my meal at Lutes Casino for the price of $4.29!

Mr. G's was the last stop for us that day. We walked in and instantly felt right at home with the Mexican vibe. I knew what every item was on the menu because my nana makes the exact things. Being so full already, we decided to split a bean and cheese burrito. With the first bite, we could already tell that the tortillas are homemade as well as the salsa. I will say the beans were very flavorful, but it needed more cheese; I only had one bite with cheese. I was very glad to eat a burrito that didn't taste processed or store bought. It was so good, I ate my entire half even though I was already full from the other meals. You can't get any better with the price of $2.53!

With my goal of spending $20 or less for all three places, my total came out to $15.81. Every place I ate at was worth the money, and I was not disappointed at.
