“Advancement via individual determination” – a fresh idea in education!

Currently open, this tutoring position offers an hourly wage of $11, flexible work hours between 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and, lastly, a chance to work with students and teachers who value education.

“As a third semester AVID tutor, I consider this program a great experience not only for the students in it but for the tutors as well,” says Alfonso Lara, a former AVID tutor. “It’s a great way to be part of something grand.”

AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) is a newly funded educational program in Yuma. This program helps the students work with each other to get to the answers by a process of inquiry rather than just depending on the tutor and teacher to show them the solution. The AVID program requires a strategic process of how tutorials are held, thus preparing students to become successful in college.

Mary Catherine Swanson started AVID 21 years go in San Diego at Clairemont High School. In 1980, she convinced a group of kids to volunteer for her experiment. Some of those early AVID students are now engineers and executives.

“The AVID program is also an excellent job for college students who need that extra financial help,” affirms AVID tutor and AWC student, Daniel Montero. “And the great part of this is that the teachers along with the tutors encourage and promote higher level thinking to the students.”

AVID training seminars are offered at AWC by Dr. Ellen Riek, professor of English, and Vanessa Natseway, Student Success Center coordinator, both of whom certify and prepare tutors with the right tools. These seminars are required for new incoming tutors. At the tutor trainings, which meet once a month, tutors have an opportunity to get their questions answered and to meet and interact with other tutors they usually do not get to work with.

Qualified students are encouraged to become part of the new AVID program now. To learn more about the AVID program link to http://www.avid.org/.
