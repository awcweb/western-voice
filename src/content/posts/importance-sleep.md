As students, we have all had to pull an all-nighter just to be able to catch up with our assignments or finish something on time. But with all that stressing over getting whatever it is done on time, we never seem to think about whether what we're doing is healthy.

It is completely understandable that some people want to put education above all else. But, when it starts to impact your daily life, that is when it starts to become a problem.

Lack of sleep can impact many aspects of your life and can cause a lot of damage to your body. It can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes, strokes and heart problems.

Not only does lack of sleep impact your health; it also starts to become an issue in the workplace. If you aren't getting your recommended eight hours, it might become harder and harder for you to wake up, especially if your work hours are early in the morning.

Sleep is an easy thing to put on the back burner especially when you have to get things done. But there are ways to help you get through everything and still rest your body.

Here are a few tips on how to get your life together:

Sacrifices must be made for the good of your health. Sometimes you have to be make hard decisions, which means, "Work hard, then play."

Tell a friend what you need to do so they can help and make sure you are actually doing it. And remember your friends are only trying to help.

Take a few breaks so you don't burn out. It's totally acceptable to take a breather, especially when you're starting to feel overwhelmed.

Don't procrastinate! This one may be the hardest one because it is so easy to procrastinate. You know you can get this done, so do it!

Your education should be put first, but when your health is being jeopardized for a good grade, that's when things get difficult. Taking care of your body should be one of your priorities because it can be harder and much more expensive to take care of it later.

Most people love sleep, so hopefully with these tips you might be getting more of it.
