Every year, around the world, exchanges are made between lovers, secret lovers and friends. Valentine's Day has brought many a day of rich romance. History's legends date back to 270 A.D, crediting St. Valentine.

One legend states that St. Valentine was a priest in Rome during the 3rd Century when Emperor Claudius had decided that single men made better soldiers. Claudius outlawed marriage for young men. However, St. Valentine rebelled and performed secret marriages. Shortly afterward, St. Valentine was condemned to death by the Emperor.

Another legend states that St. Valentine was the first to send a Valentine greeting. While in prison, St. Valentine had fallen in love with a young woman. Before his death he wrote her a love-filled letter signed, "Your Valentine."

Some believe that Valentine's Day is celebrated in the middle of February as the anniversary of St. Valentine's burial in 269 A.D.

Another icon we recognize from Valentine's Day is Cupid. In Latin, Cupid means desire. In Roman mythology, Cupid is portrayed with wings and a bow; this is also how we distinguish him today. Son of Goddess Venus and Mars, Cupid inspires love by shooting his bow.

Valentine's Day is the second most popular card-sending holiday. More than 141 million Valentine's Day cards are exchanged annually; looks like Cupid did his job.
