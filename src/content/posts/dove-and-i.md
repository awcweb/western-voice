There is a dove outside my window

cooing loudly for my attention.

I lasso my mind off of Pluto,

grateful for his small interruption.

So often we mourn for what can’t be

instead of accepting the now,

so the dove and the sunshine curtsy

with an amusing tilt of their Tao.

For the subtle ways that we harmonize

with God’s vast order in the universe,

we are left with much to theorize,

knowing peace comes to those who immerse.
