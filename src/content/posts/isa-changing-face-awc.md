Pretty girls in long, flowing white tunics, the luring subtle smells of South East Asian food, the sight of hand-woven wicker, and small figurines wearing traditional peasant headgear. Is this a far-off land? A mirage? No, it was the recent Vietnamese Festival on the AWC campus.

On Sept. 20 outside the 3C Building, the International Student Association (ISA) held this celebration of the food, history and culture of Vietnam. Students and staff were invited to taste the exotic cuisine of that country and to purchase traditional handicrafts that the students themselves had brought back with them after the Summer break.

This small group of AWC students showed great pride in their heritage, displaying large posters with detailed information about the Vietnamese tourist attractions and ecosystems, among many other topics. The girls' traditional Vietnamese dress gave the Festival its defining character.

In need of support

Hayley Bradford, the International Students Program Specialist, says that about 60 students from more than 20 countries around the world are currently enrolled at AWC, and that the College actively recruits international students who hear about the college through recruiting agents or from friends who have previously enrolled.

Many difficult steps are involved in the process come to study at AWC. Students have to guarantee funds to cover their fees, and they have to go through lengthy the application process to be granted a student visa, often from embassies in cities far from their homes. Finally, they have to leave their homeland, family and friends in search of an education that they hope will bring them a brighter future.

ISA does not help in recruiting but does offer support to new and current students who feel the crushing effects of being in a new environment perhaps thousands of miles from home. ISA also has a goal of every month putting on at least one event like the Vietnamese Festival.

Worth the trouble

Most international students report that, compared with other colleges in the U.S., AWC offers an economical education and is easier to deal with. Bradley points out that AWC does not require the English-proficiency (TOEFL) exam, as many universities do. And AWC offers international students classes in ESL for those students who are still struggling with their English.

Some students, such as soccer team member Williams Ozuma, a student from Nigeria, come because of AWC's athletic programs.

Most of the international students have felt some culture shock and speak of how homesick they sometimes get. They arrive in Yuma knowing no one; but, as many live in the on-campus dorms, friendships soon form.

"It's not easy in the beginning, but in the end it's all worth it," says Edgar Bettenwurt of Mongolia, who will be graduating from AWC this semester.
