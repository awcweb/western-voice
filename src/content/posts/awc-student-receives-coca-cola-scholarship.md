The Coca Cola All State Community College Academic Team Program recently announced the 2013/2014 awardees.

AWC student, Elizabeth Vargas received the Silver scholarship award this spring. Vargas is graduating from AWC this May.

This Scholarship is specifically for students who attend or plan to attend a two-year college and earn a two-year degree. There is fierce competition for these 400 scholarships each year. Outstanding academic rigor, grade point average, academic and leadership awards, and engagement in college and community service are evaluated in the selection process.

These scholarships are awarded at several levels. A New Century Scholar is awarded for the top scholar of each of the fifty states. These scholars receive a $2,000 scholarship. The next level of scholarship is the Gold Scholar, who is awarded $1,500, the Silver Scholar who receives $1,250 and the Bronze Scholars who receive $1,000. In addition the scholars receive a medallion signifying their scholarship status.

Coca-Cola partners with Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society to administer the program for the community colleges.
