Our proud nation has come to a crossroads concerning basic civil rights. As gun violence rises across the nation, some communities and citizens are beginning to feel that, due to their high-caliber rounds and large-capacity magazines, assault rifles have become more of a problem than a right. If they reach the wrong hands, say detractors, they will continue to be deadly weapons with the ability to harm many people with little effort. They feel that Americans do not need such high-caliber weapons for self defense and instead favor small-arms training. However, a proposed ban of these weapons has drawn objections.

Those protesting such bans point out that the Bill of Rights allows the sale of weapons in order for people to have the “security of a free State, therefore the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” Thus, the 2ndAmendment allows for people to defend themselves from a government takeover, and banning assault weapons puts citizens at a disadvantage because the government will have a stronger force than the people.

People also fear that, if these weapons are banned, street gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers will only be further empowered because they will still have these weapons, which are purchased illegally or imported.

People buy these weapons for other reasons, too, including self defense and recreational activities like hunting or target practice. Some even argue that taking these weapons out of production could result in lost jobs and prosperity.

Another common point is that it isn’t the weapons that pose the threat but rather the users themselves.

“If a person has made the decision to harm or kill others, they will do it no matter what type of weapon is available,” says one gun supporter. “If you ban these assault rifles, the crazed individual will only find the next best thing.”

If gun violence is indeed more on the person than the weapon, then perhaps we should look into the person more than the weapon itself. A stricter criminal background and psychological check should be done before issuing weapons to make sure that the person who bears these assault rifles – or any gun for that matter – is psychologically stable.

Where do you stand on this key contemporary issue? Are you willing to sacrifice a freedom for the safety of others? Should we hold a hard line on the 2ndAmendment, or should we come up with a compromise on gun control?
