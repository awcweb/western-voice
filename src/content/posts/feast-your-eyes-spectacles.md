If you’ve never been to the Art Gallery at Arizona Western College, now is the time. The Turner G. Davis exhibit features an amazing display of paintings – with colorful names like “The Swing,” “The White Dress,” “The Wild, Wild Wind,”,” “Drawing Cluster (the past),” “Drawing Cluster (the future),” “Burning Pony,” “Breathe,” “Kabul zoo revisited” and “Vesuvius” – will only be available until March 21.

The artist statement on Turner’s web site,http://www.turnergdavis.com/, reads as follows:

“I have been drawing since I was a little kid. I used to follow my parents around museums and made rudimentary sketches from canvas of the old masters. I used to watch my father draw and I discovered early on a doorway to parallel worlds scrawled into notebooks. Drawing saved me from the worst of teenage angst and served as a way forward when it seemed there was none.

“From drawing came painting. When I’m at my best, my pictures skate along a crumbly edge between autobiography and the fantastic. I try to gently examine those places where the pleasure and burden of the body intersect with the lightness of dreams and nightmares.

“I believe in being badly proficient and love exploring different styles and iconography. I am very fortunate to be able to share these images. Besides the pleasure I take in making them, and besides their capturing a viewpoint at a certain time in this journey, I am interested in the dialogue they might create.

AWC Professor of Art Bill Blomquist, this year’s Director of the Art Gallery, has long been familiar with Turner’s work.

“His mother taught me in high school and his father taught me over in University of Arizona,” Blomquist said.
