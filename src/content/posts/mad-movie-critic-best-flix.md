Check this blogspot weekly (or weakly) for the random musings of the mad movie critic - me, Dane Jacobson. My initial foray into the the world of the cyber-critique is a brief list of my top faves, filmwise. Feel free to comment:

1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

2. Inland Empire

3. The Royal Tenenbaums

4. I Heart Huckabees

5. Synecdoche, New York
