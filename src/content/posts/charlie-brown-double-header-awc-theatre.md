If you watched Charlie Brown growing up or have contemplated the existence of alternate worlds, then these two one-act plays are sure to catch your attention.

The first of the two is titled "Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead," directed by AWC theatre major Linda Torres. The play contains characters from the classic comic Peanuts, now all grown up and facing difficult challenges that many students are confronted with every day -- bullying, peer pressure, homosexuality and identity.

"CB," played by Lance Guzman, is grieving the death of his dog Snoopy and is searching for knowledge of a higher power, and in the process leans on friends for comfort. During his teenage journey, he is confronted by many challenges, as are his childhood friends, such as piano player Beethoven (Linus) played by Jonathan Vazquez and Tricia (Patty), played by Amanda Carreno.

Overall, the play evoked many emotions, addressed modern issues for teens and even included some mature humor. Guzman gave an outstanding performance as CB, maintaining many emotions throughout his character's changing conflicts.

CB's friend, Van, played by Alex Rico, continuously pleased the crowd with comedy and stayed true to his character throughout the show. And Carreno shows great potential as an actress.

The play is bold and clever despite some vulgar language and real smoking on stage. The set is also unique, as the walls turn to indicate scene changes.

The second one-acter is titled "King of Shadows," directed by Landi Rodriguez. This play is simplistic in set and characters, yet much more complex in the details of the story.

Nihar, played by George Garcia, is a 15-year-old boy trying to avoid being kidnapped by an alleged "King of Shadows" and a "Green Lady" who are from another realm. Jessica (Alma Mendoza), a graduate student wants to document his story yet finds everything hard to believe, as does her boyfriend, police officer Eric (Ron Ross). Sarah, Jessica's sister (Andrea Munguia), takes sides with Nihar and listens to his story.

The best performance of the play has to be Ross, who successfully sustains a New York accent. He also modulates his voice well and follow through with appropriate emotions.

The set is somewhat bland but as such aids viewers in focusing on the story. It is difficult to follow in some parts, more because of the script than the production. The best parts are monologues, as they express the possibility of the other realm and Nihar's story. Kudos to the lighting crew, whose spotlights really helped convey emotion.

The play is a bit complex but has an interesting story that fans of fiction, fantasy or mystery will enjoy.

Thumbs up to the theatre department for taking a different approach to Spring productions by doing two one-act plays in a single show!
