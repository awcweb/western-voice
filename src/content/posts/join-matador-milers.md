Have you ever wanted to start working out? Or you do work out but always wanted to do something more than just your regular exercise routine? Arizona Western College's own Running Club is sure to do the trick!

The Club meets Wednesdays at 4 p.m. And, if you want to start doing cardio, then come out to the fitness meeting on Fridays at 5 p.m.

"This isn't a place for who can run faster," said club President Jose VillaseÒor. It's just to have everyone come out and run."

"We just want to encourage people to come out and have fun," said member Amy Martinez. "It will also help to start having an active lifestyle."

The Running Club this year has about 10 members. Their contact information for the two advisors is as follows:

Mel Parker -- Office in 3C Bldg. Rm. 2233; phone (928) 344-7603; email mel.parker@azwestern.edu.

Ayb¸ke Keehn -- Phone (520) 262-3456; email aybuke.keehn@azwestern.edu.

The Club also takes part in 5K runs around town and will be hosting their very own 5K at the College on April 9.

Martinez said that it is fun to cheer other people on and get them to keep running.

"It's great to get people from the school or even in the community to come run," said Parker.
