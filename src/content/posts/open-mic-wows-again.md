On Tuesday, February 23 AWC held an open mic night at the Starbucks on campus.

When I got there I didn't know what to expect. I talked to a few of the performers who were going up, and a lot were nervous and excited. I didn't ask them what they were going to do because I didn't want to ruin the surprise. Maybe it was going to be music related, or maybe there would be a lot of spoken word and poetry, but I was pleasantly surprised when it started.

This event was held for all the creative individuals to share any of their talents, there was a little bit of everything, from art to music to poetry. Starbucks held a promotion for the night that offered buy-one-get-one-free Frapp√às that everyone was extremely excited about.

They kicked off the open mic night by introducing a girl who taught everyone how to sign "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." She got the audience involved, and everyone sang and signed it together.

Then the main event started, and I loved all of the poems that were performed because people got to share their creative work. Art was shown, songs were sung, and poems were read. There were a lot of amazing songs performed, we got a little taste of the band Tame Impala and even Journey. From what I could see, everyone really enjoyed the night, especially when they got into the singing.
