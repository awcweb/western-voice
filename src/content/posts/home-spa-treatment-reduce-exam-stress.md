Mid-term exams are just around the corner which means stress levels will be escalating in the next few weeks. Unfortunately, stress only causes lack of sleep and concentration, strained nerves and feelings of defeat. Treating yourself to a spa treatment will help calm frazzled nerves, but few of us can afford the extravagant cost of such a luxury while attending college. I have prepared a Home Spa Treatment Plan that will have you back to your calm, smiling, brilliant self in about 3-4 hours.

Pour a glass pitcher full of ice water and drink throughout treatment. Prepare some fresh fruit or cheese and crackers for a snack later in the treatment. Have a pen and paper handy also.

Now, begin by doing some stretches, then go out for a run or walk. Exercise for at least 20 minutes. You could also put in an exercise DVD or learn some new dance moves on YouTube.

Put some water on to boil. While you are waiting for that, eat a light protein-fortified breakfast, such as a protein shake or smoothie and a hard-boiled egg. (Protein after exercise is very beneficial.)

Now take the boiled water and steam your face under a towel for 5-10 minutes; then, give yourself a face massage and facial. (See photo for stress relieving pressure point.)

Treat your hands to a massage, softening treatment and manicure. (See hand chart for stress relieving pressure points.)

Then, add a drop of your favorite scented oil into a foot bath. Soak for 15-20 minutes.

While your feet are soaking you can enjoy a snack on the patio (or as you listen to a nature sounds CD.) Write a list of at least 10 things you are most grateful for today as you inhale the fresh air and listen to the sounds of nature.

Massage your feet (See foot chart for stress relieving pressure points) and give yourself a pedicure.

Take a long, hot bubble bath with scented candles and relaxing music.

Apply your favorite scented lotion to your body. Put gloves and socks on to trap moisture for your hands and feet.

Treat yourself to a luxurious 20 minute power nap, or longer!

This is a good home treatment for relaxing after the kids go to bed, preparing for a romantic evening or just a special self treatment after a grueling week.

If you don't have 4-5 hours for the whole treatment, just doing one of the things from the list will help considerably to make you feel happier, less stressed and clearer minded. Happy relaxing!
