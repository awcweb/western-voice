The following is an open letter to the AWC president from the sponsors of a prestigious national scholarship:

Dear Glenn Mayle,

Congratulations! Your student nominee, Neenora Khibeir, has been selected as a 2012 COCA-COLA SILVER SCHOLAR! Selection as a Coca-Cola Silver Scholar was based on scores earned in the All-USA Community College Academic Team competition, for which more than 1,700 applications were received this year. This program is sponsored by the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation and is administered by Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.

We encourage you to publicize information regarding your student's selection as a SILVER SCHOLAR. An accompanying news release is attached to be shared with your college's public relations department.

As a Coca-Cola SILVER SCHOLAR, your student will be mailed a check for $1,250 in August. Funding for the scholarship is provided by the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation. In addition, your student will receive a Silver medallion at a special recognition event. Throughout the spring, thirty eight states host All-State Academic Team Recognition ceremonies, where Coca-Cola Silver Scholars are recognized. If your scholar has not already been presented a silver medallion at your All-State Recognition Program, your student will receive this soon. If your state does not offer such a program, the medallion will be sent to your office for presentation to your student at an appropriate academic recognition program or event (such as an honors banquet or graduation). Your student's name and college will also be listed in the April 23rd issue of USA TODAY featuring the Coca-Cola New Century and Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team Scholars.

Again, congratulations to you, your college and your student on this special recognition. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact Heather Allen in our Scholarship Programs Department at 601.987.5741 or heather.allen@ptk.org.

Sincerely,
