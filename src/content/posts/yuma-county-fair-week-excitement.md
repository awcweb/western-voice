The Yuma County Fair 2011 delivered another great performance. The Fair began with the gates opening March 29 at 3 p.m. and lasted through April 3. The first day was the biggest turnout, with $1.00 admissions and the pure excitement of waiting for the Fair to open.

Rides and entertainment

With a few new additions this year, people of all ages could enjoy the thrill of a fair ride. The entire south section of the Fair was set up just for the little ones. Some of the kiddy rides this year were the mini swings, the mini fun house, the smaller ferris wheel and the kiddy cars. There were also pony rides and easier games for the kids to play.The popular rides on the main grounds were the traditional ferris wheel, the bumper cars, the zipper, the carousel and the fun houses. New attractions this year were a new roller coaster for the older crowd, an upside-down ride called the Extreme, and several other rides that spun around and went upside down.

Although the rides are the most popular part of the fair, there were many other events and showcases going on. As usual, the crowd turned out for the Demolition Derby, which took place Wednesday at 7 p.m. Families also got to enjoy the returning hypnotist, Tyzen, who put on daily shows near the beer garden, and the Clydesdale horses. People were astounded to see the huge horses and flocked around to take pictures. There was also the petting zoo and a snake exhibit featuring a python, an anaconda and a large yellow Paraguayan anaconda.

Galleries and food

One of the more artistic sides of the Fair was the photography gallery. Adults and students were welcome to turn in their best photos for view and were judged and awarded during Fair Week. Participants were allowed to enter up to four pictures per subject. Photos were judged for clarity, subject matter and focus.

One contestant was James McNeill, a regular photo contributor to the Western Voice, who entered four animal photos. This was his second year entering the contest. Although he didn't go home with any ribbons this year, he says he is not one to give up and he will enter again next year.

Of course, after the rides and the games, there is always a need for food. The fair goers had many varieties to choose from. They enjoyed the usual cotton candy, Indian fry bread, candy apples, snow cones, large dill pickles, nachos with cheese, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries and hamburgers, but then there were those treats that come once a year. People stood in line for hours just to taste the cinnamon rolls that were made fresh daily.

Animals make a fair ending

Then, who could forget to visit the animals? The 4-H and FFA animals are a must-see for every family, especially the little ones. The first stalls held the pigs and the cows, the goats and sheep were on the side, and the rabbits had their own little exhibit in front of the stalls. Although the smell is never pleasant, a visit to the animal barns is a great way to end an exciting day.

Yuma families definitely had a great time while the fun lasted; we can only wait and wonder what next year will bring when the Fair comes to visit our town again!
