On November 1, citizens from around the area of San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, assembled in solidarity against the corruption of the Mexican government and its inability to help its people. The marchers were protesting the kidnapping and murder of the 43 rural students of Ayotzinapa in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero. All demanded the same thing -- justice.

About 230 marchers began at the intersection of Libertad and 7th and ended at Juarez and 4th in front of the Municipal Palace. Many held posters with the face and name of a missing student or with writing regarding the state of the people of Mexico. Others held a white candle in memory of the students.

People who walked by or who drove by in cars yelled and honked in a show of support, saying how proud they were of the marchers for doing this. Activist Gildardo Linares led the march, leading the crowd in chants of "No estamos todos, faltan 43!" [We are all not here, 43 are missing].

The march took about an hour, and at the final destination they gathered in silence to hear what the organizers and "normalistas" [student teachers] had to say about what is happening. Jose Amparo a teacher from Tequisa, Jalisco, offered the inspiring words, " Somos un grito de esperanza" [We are all the sound of hope].

The 43 missing normalistas disappeared on Sept. 26 after a violent encounter with the police, who took them to headquarters. These students were attending Escuela Normal Rural "Raul Isidro Burgos" to become teachers in the state's poorest schools.

Many believe that the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca and wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were the ones who ordered the abduction to get rid of them. Abarca and his wife had built a narco-political territory and used the cartel Guerreros Unidos to make anyone who opposed them disappear.

Concerning a motive, some speculate that Maria de los Angeles was offended by the teachers when they came to Iguala to protest while she was giving a speech. After the disappearance of the students the mayor and his wife became fugitives but were recently captured at a hideout in Mexico City.

Following the incident, protests have taken place not only in Mexico but around the world. September 26 will be known not just as the kidnapping of the Ayotzinapa students but as the day that changed Mexico.
