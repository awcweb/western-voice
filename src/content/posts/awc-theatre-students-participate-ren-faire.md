The AWC Theatre students have announced that they will once again participate in the 2012 Two Rivers Renaissance Faire, and Pirate and Faerie Festival held at the West Yuma Wetlands State Park on February 3-5. The students and faculty will participate in this annual event as part of their outreach to the community.

AWC Theatre individuals will be serving the Faire as the Fencing Master and staff, Hawkers Guild Members, Strolling Players, and in other capacities. Please come to the Faire and support this great Yuma event. It is a home grown event that has blossomed over the last six years. AWC Theatre hopes to see you there.
