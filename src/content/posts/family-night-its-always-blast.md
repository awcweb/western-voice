The sound of laughter, the fire from a giant hot air balloon and hundreds of Arizona Western College students and staff -- all helped to make Family Night informational and most importantly fun for yet another year.

For the past 12 years AWC has put on an event for families to become more acquainted with the classes, clubs and events the college has to offer. With a rising number of attendees, the event gets bigger every year.

Clubs and teams come together and create booths to entertain or fundraise. No matter whether someone is planning on registering for classes in the spring or is just looking to become more comfortable with the school, it is always a great time to come by and see what is going on around campus.

And the 2012 event was nothing short of a resounding success.

"We are very happy with the turn out," said Shara Roberts, the college coordinator of student leadership and activities. "There was a great mix of students and residents of the Yuma area. The event has become a community event that has almost run itself -- with the help of Campus Life of course."

As the event progressed and everyone continued to buzz from booth to booth, a particularly long line formed in front of a sign that read, "Star in Your Own Music Video." Locals stood in line more than 15 minutes for a chance to feel famous.

Yuma resident Geannie Habegger expressed how great it was to have an activity that was fun and entertaining for the whole family.

"My kids love the arts and crafts booths, but I think this [Music Video Maker] is their new favorite," said Habegger as her pair of small boys rummaged through boxes and racks of props and costumes.

Another highly trafficked area was the food court where AWC's culinary students served a diverse array of food, everything from Vietnamese cuisine to chocolate cupcakes.

And what better way to enjoy these treats than by watching a performance just a few steps away? With smiles in their faces and face paint on their cheeks, children gathered in front of the Native American performers, who twirled glowing rings in their dramatic Hoop Dance.

Family Night is a great time to bring the kids and entire family to enjoy everything that AWC has to show. Whether it is creating an artistic golf ball painting at the GSA booth, having siblings become rivals in a rigorous game of soccer or holding a real live squirrel, the possibilities for fun are endless.
