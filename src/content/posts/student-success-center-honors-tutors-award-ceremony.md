The Student Success Center (SSC) held a Tutor Recognition Ceremony on April 27th to honor the hard work our dedicated tutors do. The goal of the SSC is to help students through their successful completion of courses at Arizona Western College and beyond. All of the tutors in the SSC are more than happy to help their fellow students accomplish this.

The event was filled with lots of food, fellowship and fun for all. "Student guests also attended the recognition ceremony to give their thanks to the tutors for all the help. It was a really nice event," Vanessa Natseway, Director of the SSC, stated in an email to me.

Prior to the event, the tutors were given ballots for such categories as most well-rounded, friendliest, funniest, etc and asked to vote for the tutors they felt best matched each category. There were also Certificates of Completion awarded from the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) for Level 1 Tutoring, as well as STAR and outstanding employee awards as selected by Vanessa Natseway, Ellen Riek (English professor and Faculty Liaison to the Writing Center) and Sotero Alvarado (Math Professor and Math Center Coordinator).
