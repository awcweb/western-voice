Story and photos by Aleiza Munoz

The first ever San Luis Arts Festival was held on Oct. 23 at the San Luis Learning Center (SLLC) campus. The festival was a great way for spectators to enjoy a wide range of local artistic talent.

Many tables displaying art were set up in the SLLC parking lot as well as inside the building. People attending the event cold peak to some of the artists and buy their art.

During the event there were many recitals by singers and dancers from around the area. Singers Gerardo Molina and Aquiles Garcias did a nice concert, and people enjoyed a set by LazyBeat, a local DJ from San Luis, Sonora. Herencia Gitana did a charming flamenco dance, and the South West Junior High cheerleaders cheer routine was a lot of fun.
