Student speaker, Jasmine Matthews addressed the 2011 nursing graduates during the recent pinning ceremony. Jasmine was nominated by her class to share what they went through during the nursing program.

"There were a lot of difficulties that we had with our personal lives, trying to juggle intensive class schedules around family and friends, but we all endured with the help of family, loved ones and God," Jasmine stated during her speech.

The Director of Nursing, Maryrhona Franoceur, RN, MSN placed a pin on each student as their name was called. The pin represents the care and passion that each nurse gives to their patients. The pinning ceremony is equivalent to a diploma that is handed out to students at graduation.

Each member of the class was also given a candle that was lit by their instructors signifying passing on the flame of nursing. This tradition represents Florence Nightingale who was dubbed "The Lady with the Lamp" after her habit of making rounds at night while tending the soldiers during the Crimean War.

Congratulations, Graduates!
