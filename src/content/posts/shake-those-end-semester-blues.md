Yes, it's that time of the year. Spring semester is coming to an end, and everything is chaos. You barely made it through midterms, and now you have to deal with finals, final projects -- and grades! All of those things can make you feel flustered and stressed. Not to worry, though; here are some suggestions on how to survive those end-of-semester blues.

Remember that planner that you bought way back at the beginning of the school year but never used? Well, take it out and get organized! I know it may seem basic, but writing down when all your assignments are due is much better than keeping it all in your head. So, instead of scrambling your brain, make it easier on yourself and write down everything that's important.

The next thing you should do is prioritize. For instance, start thinking of what classes and assignments need the most of your time. Say you have been doing well in one of your classes all semester and you are not worried about failing. Cut back some of the time you would focus on that class and use it to focus on another course that needs more attention. By doing so, you can make sure that at least you don't fail any of your classes.

Another suggestion is to schedule your breaks. Take some time for yourself to have some fun or to just chill. However, if you do decide to hang out with your friends, make sure that does not take away time from your assignments and responsibilities. That's why I suggest you take an active break, such as going to the gym or just for a walk around campus. Afterward, you'll be surprised how energized you feel, and you'll channel that energy into your assignments.

Most importantly, do not doubt yourself during all the chaos and stress. Breathe, organize, and take it step by step to the finish line.

I hope that by trying out some of these suggestions you will successfully complete another semester. Good luck, and go battle those semester blues!
