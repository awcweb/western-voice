Has obtaining a college education presented you with seemingly insurmountable obstacles? You could pick up a few bucks to help fund your education by writing an essay describing your trials and tribulations and how you have succeeded when others might have failed.

The National Day on Writing Essay Contest invites students at Arizona Western College to write an original essay about an obstacle they have overcome in the process of pursuing their educational goals. Entrants fall into two broad categories:
