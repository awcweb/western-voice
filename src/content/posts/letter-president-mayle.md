Dear Campus,

We had a large crowd at last week's Service Recognition Luncheon, we enjoyed great food, and we were treated to Mystery Guests Jim Amick, Terry Landers, Brenda Badilla and Ernie Fierros. In addition to our 5 year, 10 and 15 year honorees receiving a recognition pin and a Starbucks gift card, we were privileged to recognize the service of 20, 25, 30 and 35 year employees -- Daniel Russow, Terry Landers, Rakesh Pangasa, Joe Rivas, Joe Vielbig and Fred Croxen.

In addition to the Starbucks gift card and the service recognition pin, these long-serving employees' names were placed in a drawing for a $300 two-day trip anywhere in Arizona or San Diego provided by Tom Rush of Yuma Investment Group. The 35-year honoree Fred Croxen, whose wife and daughter were also in attendance, was the winner of the trip. Congratulations Fred.

A most sincere thank you goes out to those who made generous donations to this year's Charity of Choice during the luncheon. Donated to the Food Bank were non-perishable food items, one really big ham and cash donations totaling at least $852.91.

I also want to thank Sodexo catering for the great food and service; I've been told it was the best yet. Thanks to the 50th Anniversary task force, April Haile and Janet Lora, for their preparation, Facilities Services who set up tables and chairs, and the Help Desk who provided music and sound.

I thank you employees for your dedicated service to Arizona Western College and for giving me the opportunity to recognize your service. Your connection with our students, whether it be those in the residence halls, students receiving help from the Student Success Center, those researching in the library or learning in our classrooms -- each one of you touches lives of students on a daily basis, in ways you may never imagine.

I know it is sometimes challenging, but your work is significant. Every day I see our employees taking time to explain financial aid, provide academic advising, assist students with testing, faculty providing extra help for those students who ask. I value what you do. Those who commit themselves to a place like Arizona Western College make a significant personal mark and will forever be a part of this special institution. We have something in common -- we share a genuine affection for Arizona Western College. I thank you.

President Mayle
