By Nathan Green

Constantly knocking,

This stranger who sought

To enter my house

Though blinds I kept taut

Patiently waiting,

He whispered my name,

Tapping the door

Like soft, steadfast rain

Tranquilly soothing,

The sound of his voice

Invaded my thoughts

Changing my course

Familiarly trusting,

the look on his face

As I opened the door

And he entered with haste

Convincingly intriguing

He had me to sit

Rehearsing the act

While showing his kit

Passionately reasoning

All of my doubts

Reducing the price

As I kicked him out

Confidently smiling

With contract in hand

Made one last attempt

And now speechless I stand

For at the last moment

Though, resolved as I am

I sold my soul

On a “no down payment” installment plan!
