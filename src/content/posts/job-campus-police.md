Traffic every semester is a challenge at Arizona Western College not only for the students, staff and visitors, but also for the AWC Campus Police. With more than 10,000 students enrolled, the police force works hard to provide safety and security.

Officer Greg Fell retired after 30 years with the Yuma Police Department and has been working for AWC for the past seven months.

"I'm delighted to be part of this department as a patrol man," Fell said, adding that, compared to YPD, "working here is a nicer, more controlled environment."

Here is a list of Campus Police fines if you should decide you want to tangle with them.

Illegal parking $15.00

Failure to properly display permits $15.00

Driving on Campus sidewalks/non-roadways $15.00

Removing a barricade or other traffic control device$25.00

Failure to yield for a pedestrian $25.00

Exceeding fifty (50) decibels of sound, measured at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the instrument causing the sound $25.00

Falsifying information of campus vehicle registration$50.00

Displaying an illegal, altered, or substituted permit $50.00

Illegal parking in a handicapped space $75.00

College traffic citation fines must be paid within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of issue to the cashier in the college Business

A late fee of $15 will be charged for any citation fine not paid or appealed within fourteen (14) calendar days from the issuance of the citation. For more information on fine fees for other violations you can go to www.azwestern.edu/campus police.

Bottom line: Avoid getting a ticket and save your money.

Fell said that Campus Police also offer evening escort services to parking lots, assist with vehicle problems such as locked cars or dead batteries, provide bank runs, building access and security, and respond to incidents or investigate crimes normally related with drugs or alcohol.
