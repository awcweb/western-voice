[Unsigned Editorial]

If you like to write, meet new people and increase your networking capabilities and knowledge of media, then the News Writing class (JRN 125) is for you. Oh, and you'll get your work published too, in print and online.

You'll learn how to write news and feature articles on various subjects, such as campus events, human interest, sports, entertainment and editorial. You'll learn to make connections with campus faculty and staff, and you'll become more comfortable meeting new people. You'll also learn such skills as how to properly interview people and what kind of pictures to take.

In publishing your articles, you'll also begin building a writing portfolio. You can list such accomplishments on your resume and on scholarship or employment applications. Besides the local notoriety of being published in the campus newspaper, Western Voice, you'll have a worldwide readership for your online work.

After writing articles in the class, you'll dramatically improve your writing skills and you'll have an increased appreciation of the media that surrounds us.

Don't have time or money to take the class? You can still write for us! We always accept work by people of the AWC campus community, including photos and Letters to the Editor.

Still need some convincing? Check out our website www.azwesternvoice.com or our Facebook page to learn more about what kind of articles we produce.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to broaden your horizons, become a better writer and develop a professional skill-set that's great for many careers in the communications media.
