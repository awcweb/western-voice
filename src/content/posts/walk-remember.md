Although I'm a student at Arizona Western College, it suddenly occurred to me that I don't know a whole lot about the school. I am much older than most of my classmates, and I haven't been to school for about 30 years. Also I only have one class on campus, while my other three classes are online. So I went on a walk around campus to get to know my school.

The first thing I did was to pop in on my Graphic Communications professor, and what a great experience that was. Besides the fact that his office was the size of a shoebox, I found myself in awe of how he handles his classes online. I've even started looking for an excuse to visit him again soon. Who knows, maybe I'll tank a couple a homework assignments.

I remember that when I first registered for classes it was pretty crazy, so I took a stroll to the second floor of the CCC building, where the processing center is. This time I could take my time and ask a few questions and really get to find out what each department does. I found everyone to be professionals of the highest caliber -- even the cashier, who gladly took my $15.00 away from me for speeding on campus.

I have already spent time in the computer room, and all I can say is "wow." I can get done in 20 minutes what takes me an hour at home.

I toured the library and found it to be more than adequate for the research that is needed for each subject.

Next I took a stroll to the gym because I like to pump iron sometimes. After all, a 54-year-old has to keep up with his two teenage daughters. I work out at the MCAS gym, but I found the AWC gym to have a nice, cozy atmosphere for spending an hour grunting and moaning.

Finally, I went to Starbuck's for a regular coffee. (I just can't see myself drinking a coffee with caramel and whipped cream in it.) I sat down outside on one of the benches and realized what a beautiful campus this really is. This had indeed been a walk to remember.
