What is Twitter? Well, nothing more than another social network. Nowadays, it is rare not to have a social network account as a college student, be it on Twitter, Facebook or Myspace.

For the past semester I have fallen head-over-heels for Twitter. I love to tweet! I have become addicted.

Twitter is basically updates. You can synchronize your account to your phone and send texts which post in your Twitter.

Many may not understand what the craze for this social network has become for me, but I have proudly introduced this network to various friends.

I'll tweet about my day, a random thought, pictures, perhaps a quote if I am in the mood. It feels many times like a mini-blog. Many close friends mock my obsession for this network giant, but that really doesn't bother me. I'll tweet when I am sad, happy, sober or just feeling random.

Privacy has always been an issue for me. However, through the privacy settings, I am able to keep away those eyes that I don't want wandering through my innermost thoughts. In Twitter-land you can follow as many people as you choose -- from famous artists to movie characters to just your friends. I am huge on Twitter! I have fallen head-over-heels for Twitter. I love to tweet! I have become addicted.
