The Center for Teaching Effectiveness (CTE) had been accepting nominations for the 2010 Teacher of the Year Award at Arizona Western College through Thursday, Oct. 15, and is now beginning the next step in the selection process.

The Teacher of the Year (TOY) Award is more than a pat on the back. In fact, says CTE Director Nancy Blitz, "I would really like to see more students get involved in this. They know what teachers they like."

Nominations were made by AWC students, faculty and staff.

Upon review of nominations, one full-time and one part-time associate faculty member will be selected. Associate faculty nominees must have six semesters completed at AWC. Both winners will receive an invitation to attend a professional conference and will be honored with a reserved parking space. They also will be recognized at the January all-faculty meeting. The full-time Teacher of the Year will be honored at the Yuma County Teacher of the Year Banquet.

The TOY selection process is integrated and engaging. It involves students and teachers in a multi-step process that spans about six weeks. After all letters of nomination have been submitted, the nominees are asked if they want to accept or decline the nomination. If they accept, Blitz then visits the classrooms of the nominees to evaluate their teaching methods. The nominee must also fill out a question and composition form. Students from the class are also interviewed. Once all is complete, a ballot is sent to other faculty members.

AWC began the Teacher of the Year Award program in 1989, when Harold Anderson won. Since then, many familiar teachers have made the list -- Chuck Smalley, Fred Coxen, Peter Morse, George Montopoli, Nancy Blitz, Tim Whittier and Scott McLean, to name a few. A full list is available at the CTE website.

Teachers are nominated by students in the form of a letter explaining how the teacher meets six criteria:

Exhibits exemplary performance in the classroom

Is accepted and respected by colleagues and administrators

Is innovative, creative and enthusiastic

Is involved in pursuing professional enrichment and intellectual growth

Has demonstrated outstanding contributions and /or leadership in the school, district, community and profession.

Exhibits a willingness to share expertise with others.

Congratulations and good luck to all of the new nominees for the 2010 Teacher of the Year Award!
