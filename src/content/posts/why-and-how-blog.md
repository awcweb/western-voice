Many people blog nowadays -- students, teachers, adults old and young, and many others.

What's so great about a blog? Why do people wish to share every little thing that has happened in their day? After all, the events in one's day usually are not very entertaining, and not everyone cares to read every detail of them.

However, there is a huge misconception about blogs. Most people think they are only used for an online, open diary. Of course many may be diaries, but others are used for various reasons, such as for business purposes, to display artwork or photography, or to publish creative writing.

The most common blogs have been created to display people's creativity. Blogs are interesting and can contain very nice art or photographs. Since these types of bloggers might not get to have their work displayed in a gallery or published in a book, a blog is a great way for them to share with a large audience. If the right people catch on to their work online, then it might be a gateway to actually being displayed in a gallery someday

A major concern of anyone who publishes something online is privacy. When something is shared online, it is easily seen by whoever stumbles upon that web page. A good thing about most web pages is that who gets to see it and who doesn't can be controlled, at least up to a point.

If a blogger doesn't want something to be released to the public, then it shouldn't be posted at all. Or maybe blogs aren't even the right venue for that person.

For an example of a blog created for photographic purposes, visit greenks.blogspot.com! And to create one of your own you can visit blogger.com.

Blogs are very simple to create, even for free! The blogger.com site has several templates available, with different designs, colors, and fonts added to help the blogger create a unique page.

The new blogger must, of course, think of a log-in name and password. Then there is a choice of templates and names for the page. From that point, the website gives step-by-step assistance for the new blog. From the most inexperienced to seasoned computer users, blogger.com is an easy and efficient way of making a professional-looking web page. Why and How to blog
