Kathy Ocampo, the new Interim Associate Dean of La Paz County Services has great excitement and passion toward improving student services and creating stronger alliances with the community of La Paz County. Motivation and confidence have been her foundation in her rise to prominence at Arizona Western College.

"I oversee any type of services offered to our La Paz County constituents," Ocampo says of her new role at the Parker Learning Center. Being the "eyes and ears for our county," she and her staff are "working with Main CampusÖto better meet the needs of the constituents of our county."

Beyond her job description, she wants to continue to build partnerships within the community, and she wants people to know, "Our doors are open for anybody looking to be involved in life-long learning."

The partnerships she would ideally like grow are a "never-endingÖongoing process." Such alliances with PAACE and Red Ribbon Week give a positive message to the community and motivate a healthy lifestyle. She explains that the Learning Center staff likes to attend events and welcomes new partnerships.

A rise to prominence

Ocampo began working for AWC as a front desk clerk with such tasks as helping students with applications and testing. As a full time student, she received her Associate's Degree and went on get her Bachelor of Science, double major, through Northern Arizona University. From there she earned her Master's in psychology from Grand Canyon University.

Having started her family before continuing her education, Ocampo is fond of saying, "I did life a little backwards." Backwards or forward, she accomplished a great feat by continuing her education while working and raising her family.

Ocampo continued within AWC working as the Academic Services Coordinator, gaining experience in class building, program development and outreach. She also spent a year in the Quartzsite Learning Center as the Academic Support Coordinator.

An encouraging message

As a former student herself, Ocampo sees the Los Toros De La Paz student club as a way of expanding student involvement while forming a community within the La Paz learning centers. Club members are connected through ITN video conferencing between the Parker and Quartzsite centers.

The club is flexible to student hours and is not limited to educational activities. Instead, it welcomes member ideas on projects, volunteer work or fundraisers for trips and events. The club gives students the chance to meet other members who might be going through similar experiences and to form bonds rather than simply attending classes.

The most interesting aspect of Ocampo's job and what she is most passionate about is making a difference in one person's life -- just knowing that someone found self-fulfillment through certificate programs, attending a few classes or personal-enrichment courses.

With an encouraging message to her faculty as well as to current and future students, Kathy will continue to have a huge impact on students' lives.
