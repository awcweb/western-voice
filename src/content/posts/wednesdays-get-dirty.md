Students from AWC are giving residents of Yuma a comedic/variety TV show that they will never forget.

The show is known as  The Dirty Thirty  and it is unlike any other on television. Under the watchful eye s of instructors Sherry Needham , Travis Mitchell and Troy Baughtman , television production students are able to put on a different show each week dealing with whatever topics they choose to cover.

The show is hosted by four of the AWC students while the rest of their classmates take on such roles as director, cameraman, editor, production assistant, technic al producer and audio producer . Some of the various (and sometimes wild) segments o f the show so far have included having a "drink a gallon of milk in under an hour" challenge, beating an ice cream record, having special guests appear on the show, interviewing random people around the college and even having the students make some personalized hilarious skits.

Dirty Thirty  host Roger Martinez says , "I love how we all rely on each other to ma ke the show a success. The team work is great , and I like how we are given the opportunity to do anything we want. I love everything about the show."

N ot only is the show something fun for the students to do, it al so gives them some real- world experience about the television business.

Dirty Thirty  director Abel Montoya says that he likes having "experience as a director and knowing how a production really runs while also being able to use creative thinking" He also adds that "working with the show really gives me an insight on the different job titles and it is great working with the equipment the college has to offer."

Camera woman for the show, Justine Aston, also puts in her two cents and states , "I'm learning a lot about television production , and that is something I plan to use when I start my career."

They are not only entertaining peo ple and having a blast doing it, but they're getting an education as well. By any account , it seems to be the perfect formula for success.

To catch the show for yourself and to see what all the fuss is about make sure to watch the show every Wednesday from 5:00- 5:30 p.m. on AWC channel 74.
