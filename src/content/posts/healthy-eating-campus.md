We college students live a fast-paced life. From rushing between classes to worrying about grades to catching up on much needed sleep, which of us has the time to worry about what we eat? Luckily, the food services at Arizona Western College is dedicated to accommodating all our nutritional needs, and that's one less thing for us to worry about.

The four food operations on campus -- the Eatery, the LR Fountain Kiosk, Starbucks and the catering service -- all fall under the management of Sodexo, a national food service company that works with colleges and student food service committees to provide nutritious meals and a "personalized service for a pleasant dining experience," as stated on the AWC website.

"We offer a balanced mix, and we like to give our customers options," says General Manager Jon Giesler, who has worked in the college food-service business since 1977.

Among these options is the ability to customize anyone's order. For example, if any of us happens to be vegetarian or vegan, we wouldn't have to limit ourselves to the salad bar. All we have to do is tell a staff member, who will gladly personalize the meal.

"We need to try to meet as many students' needs as possible," says Giesler.

Sodexo is also known for providing healthy and nutritious options for their customers.

"My mission statement is to serve a quality product," says Giesler.

An information table in the Eatery provides several pamphlets on mindful eating for those interested in nutrition and in tips on how to get a well-balanced meal.

On booklet on that table helps patrons track nutrition and fitness with the myfitnesspal app, which allows its users to find items and scan barcodes to give nutritional information on that product.

Giesler also has an idea to bring dieticians from the hospital to come to the College and answer questions that anyone might have concerning eating habits and routines.

"Just understand what you're eating," is Gieslers' advice.
