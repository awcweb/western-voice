Some Arizona Western College departments went all out for the Annual Office Decorating Contest this Halloween.

With Campus Life as reigning champs for the past two years, many believed they had it in the bag. However this didn't keep the Admissions & Registration department from making a coming from behind to attain the top spot this year.

"We took it back!" said the Admissions crew after their win.

With their "Alice in Underland" setting, dead bodies covered every station. And, with their faculty and staff dressed as different characters from the Alice in Wonderland movie, it was the perfect combination of creative and creepy.

Coming in second place was Campus life with their colorful display of Candyland. Having different sweet worlds at every workstation, the judges had a tough call.

In third place was the KEYS program with their Sanderson Witches museum filled with creepy dolls, spider-web covered potion and old witch's artifacts.

Overall the departments brought their Halloween spirits to the AWC campus and gave students a little taste of scary, sweet and fun at the same time.
