One of the many great things about getting a college education is the different types of people you will meet along the way -- especially if take the opportunity to study abroad.

If you are interested in studying abroad during your time at AWC, the International office is there to help. Kenneth Kuntzelman, director of the International Students Program, is also the Study Abroad Advisor, and he is very knowledgeable about the hundreds of available programs and scholarships, including many that will send students to developing countries in the Middle East and Africa.

Studying abroad is so much more than an opportunity to go to school in a new place; it is a chance to expand your knowledge of people and culture and get a feel for the world.

"It is important to learn about the greater part of humanity while getting an education," shares Kuntzelman.

He also talked about the fact that many growing companies have offices of international affairs and, when looking for future employees, like to see someone who can have a relationship with other countries.

Kuntzelman is excited about what he does and is willing to help anyone wanting to study abroad. The International Department is located upstairs in the 3C Bldg., right next to Campus Life. If you are interested in the program or would like a chance to meet with international students, the international program has a club, called the I-Team, which meets every Thursday at 4:40 p.m. in the conference room upstairs in the 3C building.

The I-Team puts on cultural celebrations and other activities. Anyone is welcome to attend, and the club looks forward to new members.
