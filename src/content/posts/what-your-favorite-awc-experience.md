AWC is participating in the Student essay contest offering $3000 in prizes sponsored by the National Institute of Staff and Organizational Development (NISOD) -Community College Week. Essays must be in by November 8, 2010.

The essay topic must describe your most rewarding learning experience with a faculty, staff, or administrator at your community college. If you've told your friends about a favorite AWC experience a hundred times now is your chance to put your pen where your mouth is.

The $3000 prize money will be divided as such:

$1,000 Scholarship to the Student Author

$1,000 to the Faculty/Staff/Administrator Featured in the Essay

Complimentary 2011-2012 NISOD Membership to the Student's Community College ($1,000 value)

The contest began in honor of Scott Wright, past editor of Community College Week (1995--2000), recipient of the 1998 Award for Excellence in Higher Education Journalism, and the reporter who brought national attention to developmental education and the unique mission community colleges possess in providing an accessible education.
