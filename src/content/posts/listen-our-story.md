Have you been walking around lately on the campus of Arizona Western College and thought you heard voices in your head?

That's always possible, of course.

But, before you rush to get your head examined, you might want to at least look around and see if there something that looks like a memorabilia case nearby. If there is, look down and see if you're standing on a square with two red boot prints and the words, "Stop here."

If all that checks out, you can relax and take your therapist's phone number off speed dial. You're standing under one of the three an AWC 50th Anniversary "listening station," one of three scattered across campus.

Each of these three memorabilia cabinets has a particular theme -- "Education" in the SC building, "Transformation" in the 3C lobby and "Legacy" in the LR atrium. Each case features historic items, both from our own archives and donated from the public (including a 1965 diploma in the SC).

Each case also features a suspended motion-activated, unidirectional dome speaker with a playlist of four "voices" talking about the history of AWC, accompanied by a large banner on the wall with a picture and description of the speaker.

Information on the "voices" in the first round of playlists is provided below -- identifying the speaker and including the theme and the run time for each. These groupings will run for five weeks in the fall semester, from Oct. 31--Dec. 5. They will be changed in January and again in March.
