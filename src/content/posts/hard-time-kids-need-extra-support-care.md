When schools were closed because of the pandemic, children had to adapt to the new educational practices. In these tough times, children need special assistance and treatment from parents and teachers alike.

“The parents’ support for the student is important and fundamental,” says elementary school teacher Jaziel Puentes, not just during this pandemic period but throughout their educational journey.

The attention that parents give to students is reflected in activities and assigned tasks, in the construction of values such as responsibility, punctuality and good organization, and even in personal hygene.

“The support of parents is very important, as long as they are only there for support when the children have difficulties and not helping them by giving them the answers,” said Julissa Prieto, the mother of Arturo, a sixth-grade student.

As a negative factor in this new learning environment, Prieto said that sometimes children do not pay attention or fully engage in activities while they are in class. For this reason, parental supervision is also important while children are attending classes from home.

She said that she is aware of her son at all times while he is in class – in case he needs something, in case he does not understand any instructions or in case he has problems with the computer or the Internet.

Puentes said that an important factor in supporting his students is paying close attention to the parents regarding the activities they are engaged in with their children, answering those parents’ questions and responding to their suggestions, and dispelling their doubts and concerns.

Of course, support is also provided directly to the students in the form of finding the best ways to connect with them through either the various platforms that exist or even bibliographic material.

“Support is provided in consideration of the different needs of students and parents,” Puentes said.

Prieto’s son Arturo said he prefers face-to-face classes as he feels more encouraged. With virtual classes, he says, it is more difficult to learn.

In short, in order to adapt to the unprecedented circumstances of the present, teachers find themselves working extra hard, not only in teaching their students but also in supporting the greater role that must be played by those children’s parents.
