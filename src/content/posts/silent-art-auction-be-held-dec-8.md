It's said that everyone sleeps under the same stars. In the spirit of that idea, Dec. 8 will see a showcase of artistic talent from both sides of the border -- an event at the San Luis Public Library called "Art Walk: A Night under the Stars."

The main organizers will be Border 2 Bridge, a group of Arizona Western College students under the leadership of Antonio Carrillo. "The goal of this initiative is to empower students to make excellent choices, choose positive attitudes, and select careers in the arts that will enhance their lives today, tomorrow, and in the future," said Carrillo.

Also participating will be Expresearte San Luis, Genaro Garcia, Angel Luna, Jose T. Ordu√ío, Maria Terriquez and students from San Luis High School.

Each piece of art will be available for purchasing. The funds collected will then be used to enhance Main Street in San Luis with festive banners highlighting the talents of local artists who have contributed to the cultural life of the San Luis community. These banners will be ready to put up early in 2012.

NIght under the Stars will be a night of color and artistic talent not soon to be forgotten.
