The Yuma Private Industry Council (YPIC) offers grants to students who are in need of a career to help build the labor market here in Yuma County.

If you are looking for a career and need funds for school, you may want to visit YPIC's friendly and resourceful staff. They offer services that help people find a field they can enter and to help locate a job after that person completes the necessary training.

"You do have to qualify for the grant; we ask that you come into the office to apply for that," said Sonia Bautista, a YPIC Career Resource Center coordinator. "Most of our programs are for low-income families."

Bautista also said that these grants have an $8,000 cap and are federally and state funded. Each year the number of grants given out depends on the number of applicants. "...we can help them with the certificate programs." said Ana Garcia, another YPIC Career Resource Center coordinator. These programs include automotive technician, electrician, infant and toddler education, nursing assistant, radiologic technician, and welding. Students need to come in and apply for the grant when they start enrolling at AWC.

"Once they've applied for it and qualified, they will go through testing in reading, math, and language," said Bautista. "Then they will be assigned a worker where they will start the program."

Garcia said AWC isn't the only college the student can attend. The website called Arizona Heat lists providers and programs approved through the Department of Labor in order for the student to use these grants.

After completion of the program, YPIC also assist students once they complete training. "There is going to be a case worker assigned to them and they're the ones that assist them with their job search," Garcia said.
