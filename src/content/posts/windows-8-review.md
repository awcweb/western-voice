The latest version of the Microsoft computer operating system, Windows 8, has been out for a few months now. Every new system has a bit of a learning curve, and a lot of people hesitate to upgrade, but the radical changes to this OS make it incomparably more difficult than Windows 7, XP or Vista.

The first thing you'll notice is the large menu screen which replaces the start menu you're used to at the left corner of your older windows OS. It's too bulky, and you have to make unnecessary clicks to get to your desktop. It seems that, for every task on Windows 8, more clicks are required than on previous systems. This makes me question if the creators of this OS wanted to help the chiropractic industry, because after extended use of this OS you're sure to develop carpal tunnel syndrome.

If you scroll to the right of your start screen there is another bunch of commands like Settings, Start, Share and Search. If you do not see it right away, don't worry because it's hidden in the corner. I can't comprehend why such an important feature as Settings would be hidden off in corner like this. And Start is just a shortcut to the desktop, which is confusing.

One positive change to Windows 8 is access to the app store directly from your computer. If you're a smart-phone user, you're used to this concept. This avoids the need to go to any questionable pages in order to download programs like Skype, Microsoft Office or even Angry Birds. Tons of free apps are at your disposal as well as some paid ones. Once you've downloaded them, you have the option to pin them to your start screen or desktop.

At this point, my advice is to save your money and invest in a Mac. There's just too much going on, and Windows is seemingly going through an identity crisis. I regret spending $600 on something that causes more headaches than the homework I do on it.
