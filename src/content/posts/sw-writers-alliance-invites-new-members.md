The Southwest Writers Alliance, a new organization at Arizona Western College, is for everyone interested in any aspect of writing. It originated as a forum for students in AWC Creative Writing classes to meet informally and to have a support group when their classes are over. The parameters of the club have grown to include people who like to read, share their writing, discuss works by other writers or just break down barriers in communication.

The Writers Alliance, which serves the entire AWC/NAU Campus, is still accepting new members. Any student, faculty member or employee here is eligible to join this club. Here writers find a friendly audience to share feedback, to have fun and to socialize with others of like mind. There are no requirements for members and no pressure to produce work -- only that they be open-minded and participate as they feel compelled.

"I firmly believe that the formal education we receive in college is only one part of the experience," says AWC English Professor Ric Jahna, faculty advisor for the club. "This is an opportunity to meet with one another outside of the structures of the curriculum and promote the exchange of ideas in a fun and safe place, which is what education is all about. "
