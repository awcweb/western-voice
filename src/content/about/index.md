After decades of distinguished existence as a conventional campus newspaper – evolving through various formats, from saddle stitch to broadsheet to tabloid – the Western Voice has now transitioned into a comprehensive digital archive. This online archive preserves the legacy of the Western Voice newspaper, offering a curated collection of past issues and content, which once served as the primary voice of Arizona Western College before the publication shifted to a podcast format.

Western Voice: Campus Journalism of Arizona Western College, once sponsored by the Communications Division of Learning Services (Dr. Linda Elliott-Nelson, Vice President), was a key product of the AWC Media Arts program. Historically, the content of the Western Voice was produced primarily by students in the News Writing and Photojournalism courses, but it also featured contributions from various college programs, organizations, and individuals from both the campus and the local community.

The faculty advisor was Dr. Michael Miller.
